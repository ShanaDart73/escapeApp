“He went back before the matter was resolved?!” exclaimed Jiāng Chéng.

Then, with a hint of doubt in his tone, he said, “Besides, with his personality, it’s quite strange that he didn’t capture that monster alive to study it.”

Although it was hard for him to admit it, Jiāng Chéng knew that Wèi WúXiàn always did things thoroughly, from start to finish.

This time, however, he went back to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, leaving behind a case that was unique and unheard of! So, obviously, Jiāng Chéng was sceptical about it.

In the Gūsū territory, people liked to brew their own glutinous rice wine, as well as their exquisite Emperor’s Smile. So, no cases related to that monster’s wine had occurred in their region.

“Why was he in such a hurry to go back?” Jiāng Chéng pondered, “Could it be that he has been injured?!”

He then stared at Jīn Líng, and the latter broke out in a cold sweat. He exclaimed, “Uncle, why do you care so much about it? Wèi WúXiàn must have business to attend to. Surely, he should be busy.”

“Busy?” Jiang Cheng uttered doubtfully, “No matter how busy he is, he will definitely accompany you home. Don't try to hide it from me. Is he injured?”

Jiang Cheng’s sentence, <em>‘No matter how busy he is, he will definitely accompany you home.’</em>, echoed in Jīn Líng’s head, then, suddenly, he was stunned as if he had been struck by lightning.

He quickly recalled that each time when they finished their Night Hunting, Wèi WúXiàn would make a shameless excuse to come here, at Jīnlíntái.

Even when his trip back home to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù was the shortest, Wèi WúXiàn would rather make a detour in order to pass by Jīn Líng’s residence.

“So, all this time he was making those excuses was actually to escort me home?” Jīn Líng came to the realisation.

All of a sudden, he was seized by an overwhelming emotion and couldn't find his words. “Wèi WúXiàn, you’re really——,” he thought, “How can someone possibly describe you?”

“He did a similar thing this time, too, after we had finished Night Hunting,” Jīn Líng went on. “Although he had already fixed the date of his return and even promised HánGuāng-Jūn that he would be back that day, at the last minute, when we’ve learned about the incidents that happened in Lánlíng and Yúnmèng territories, not only did he change his plan, but also he urged HánGuāng-Jūn to join us to investigate the matter.

“Each time, he seems ready to go the extra mile just for the sake of seeing me back home safely or helping me solve the issue that happens in Lánlíng territory.”

Since Jīn Líng didn’t say anything for a while, Jiang Cheng assumed he finally admitted that his speculation about Wèi WúXiàn being injured was true.

Then, while gritting his teeth, he asked, “Where is Lán WàngJī? Wasn't he with you during the Night Hunting?”

Jīn Líng became suddenly alarmed and thought, “Why, out of nowhere, does he bring HánGuāng-Jūn into our conversation?”

“Yes, he was with us,” he quickly replied.

“Where is he now?” Jiang Cheng asked.

“He went back to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù,” Jīn Líng replied, then thought, “Did my uncle guess about HánGuāng-Jūn? I'm sorry, SīZhuī.”

Then, with a pleading tone, Jīn Líng said, “Uncle, since you have guessed it, please don't make it public, so as not to cause a turmoil among people.”

“Don’t make it public?!” Jiang Cheng thundered, while his eyes were blazing with anger, “Who said that?”

Without letting Jīn Líng reply, he went on, “So, just because he's not technically a member of the GūsūLán clan, he can be bullied? And, when something happens to him, it can’t be made public! Well, Lán WàngJī, you've got some guts!”

Dumbfounded, Jīn Líng asked, “Who doesn't count as a member of the GūsūLán clan? Uncle, why are you so angry?”

“You couldn't even protect him, but you are worried about the commotion that will arise if other people find out?! I will see if you can stop me!” Jiang Cheng went on furiously.

“Who didn’t protect whom?" Jīn Líng kept asking, “Uncle, do you mean that Wèi WúXiàn didn’t protect HánGuāng-Jūn? Why are you so angry that HánGuāng-Jūn is not properly protected?”

Jīn Líng was confused and couldn’t figure out why his uncle was so furious. As for Jiang Cheng, since he was already fuming, he paid no heed to what Jīn Líng said.

He stormed out of the room, drew his Sāndúyù*, stepped on it, and before flying away, he said, “Jīn Líng, as a sect leader, you must have the demeanour of a leader. While I am away, search for the whereabouts of Jīn Chǎn. Did you hear me?”

<small>*Sāndúyù is the name of Jiang Cheng’s sword.</small>

Jīn Líng noticed in horror that the direction his uncle took led to the GūsūLán sect.

“Does my uncle want to settle accounts with Wèi WúXiàn for HánGuāng-Jūn’s sake?” At this thought, he felt chills running through his body. He suddenly shivered.

Jīn Líng went on, “Can someone tell me who I should help if those two get into a fight?”

Then, something crossed his mind: “Wait a minute! This is not good! Uncle, can you beat Wèi WúXiàn?!” Jīn Líng got worried.

As the purple light emitted by his uncle’s sword disappeared in the sky like a shooting star, Jīn Líng reacted, wanting to follow him.

However, before he could step on his sword, Jiang Cheng’s underlings stopped him, and one of them said, “Young Leader, please, don’t take offence. It is wise to prioritise the task that Jiang Zōng-zhǔ has entrusted to you.”

Thinking of Jīn Chǎn’s case that was still unsolved, Jīn Líng stamped his foot in frustration. However, he was still anxious about a potential fight between his uncle and Wèi WúXiàn.

He then thought, “Oh my, Uncle, they have already become a couple. Why do you want to meddle in their affairs?”

Suddenly, he remembered that he had a transmitter talisman, which was given to him by Wèi WúXiàn during their Night Hunting.

“I almost forget that I have this good stuff,” he thought. Then he quickly returned to his room, took out the talisman from his sleeve, and wrote a few words on it.

Then, holding the talisman between two fingers, Jīn Líng gathered his spiritual energy to these fingers to burn the talisman.

Wèi WúXiàn told them that he had improved his transmitter talisman. As long as the receiver had the same talisman on him, he would receive the message immediately after the sender burned his own talisman.

Jīn Líng had already agreed with Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí that they would communicate with each other via their talismans, so they should receive his message.

After burning the transmitter talisman, Jīn Líng sent a group of his loyal underlings to seize Jīn Chǎn’s assets, as well as to arrest anyone who had a close relationship with Jīn Chǎn.

He also planned on taking into account all the transgressions that he had overlooked and severely punished those who had committed them, without any leniency.

He then assigned someone to gather information that would lead to Jīn Chǎn's hidden location.

In the Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù medical care building, doctors were busy taking care of those common people who had been affected by the monster’s wine.

They had given them some medicines that would restore their energy lost during their capture in the cave.

According to these doctors’ observations, the pulses of those people were somehow beating faster, and, occasionally, they had nightmares during their sleep.

Lán Yǎn was the most experienced doctor among others. He had been practising medicine for many generations and was highly respected.

However, after probing several times with his spiritual energy, Lán Yǎn could not determine what was wrong with those people, which puzzled him greatly.

As he was frowning in thought and staring blankly at the floor, a pair of white boots with silver patterns entered his field of vision.

He looked up and saw that it was Lán XīChén and hurriedly saluted him.

Lán XīChén smiled and said, “Thank you all for your hard work and dedication. I came to see how those people are doing.”

While stroking his beard, Lán Yǎn informed Lán XīChén about the symptoms he had observed. Then, noting that Lán XīChén seemed not to be surprised, he asked, “Zéwú-Jūn, have you already discovered something about this matter?”

“Yes,” replied Lán XīChén, “I learned how one of our disciples found a way of eliminating those symptoms.” Then he added, “WàngJī has already woken up.”

Lán Yǎn exclaimed, “That's great!”

After a short pause, he said, “Èr-gōngzǐ’s spiritual energy is very powerful. It's not really surprising that he could wake up so quickly.”

Recalling the scene of his young brother hugging Wèi WúXiàn and being unwilling to let go of him, Lán XīChén could not help but smile to himself.

He then said, “Although he has woken up, however, he is still drunk. And I don't know what he is doing right now.”

Surprised, Lán Yǎn remarked, “Since he has regained consciousness, why is he still drunk? That wine is indeed very unusual.”

Lán XīChén said inwardly, “I'm afraid it's something about WàngJī, which is unusual.”

At that moment, one of those common people began to wriggle his body in panic, and, with both hands grabbing the edges of the bed, he was muttering some unintelligible words.

Lán Yǎn was about to go and check on him, but Lán XīChén gently stopped him. He then walked to that person’s bed, took out Lièbīng* and brought it to his lips. A clear and peaceful melody soon filled the room.

<small>*Lièbīng is the name of Lán XīChén’s flute.</small>

The sound of that melody was exceptionally gentle and warm. And Lán Yǎn looked around in surprise. The expressions of those people slowly became calm, and their whole bodies began to relax.

Lán XīChén carried on playing his flute while injecting a small amount of his spiritual energy through the melody he produced.

Soon after, the smell of the wine started to waft away from those people. Lán Yǎn and the other doctors were dumbfounded.

“This smell is like an evil resentment; it possesses people and goes undetected,” thought Lán Yǎn. “It’s really weird and frightening. Luckily, HánGuāng-Jūn had wiped out all of them. Otherwise, the disaster could have been unimaginable.”

The doctors held their breath to prevent inhalation of that smell and retreated further away, leaving Lán XīChén to handle all this.

With a gentle movement of his right hand, Lán XīChén summoned Shuòyuè*. He then swung his sword, and the edge of the blade glowed with the spiritual light that swept across the room.

<small>*Shuòyuè is the name of Lán XīChén’s sword.</small>

The strong smell of alcohol was immediately eliminated by the sword energy.

Lán XīChén then sheathed his sword and said to the doctors, “Everything should be all right now. Please, keep taking care of those people until they wake up. If there is nothing wrong with their condition, I will get some disciples to escort them to their homes.”

They all nodded in agreement and took notes of these unusual symptoms for future reference.

Before Lán XīChén could take his leave, Lán Yǎn asked, “Zéwú-Jūn, does Èr-gōngzǐ need some medicine for the hangover?”

Thinking of Lán WàngJī acting like a spoiled child when he was drunk, Lán XīChén smiled and replied, “He probably won’t need it.”

Glancing at Lán Yǎn, who had been attending to them since they were kids, and now his hair had grown grey, Lán XīChén said, “WàngJī has someone who is taking good care of him.”

Lán Yǎn then understood, smiled with satisfaction, and saw off Lán XīChén at the door.

When he was young, Lán Yǎn was chosen to be the physician of the GūsūLán lineage.

However, except for treating injuries of the disciples returning from their Night Hunting, and taking care of some female disciples who were relatively weak, Lán Yǎn and the other doctors didn’t have many occasions to employ their skills.

This was due to the strict rules of GūsūLán, and all members rigorously observed the sect teachings. Furthermore, they were good at martial art cultivation, and their health condition was excellent.

However, being in that position, all doctors had to comply with their duties. So, Lán Yǎn had kept practising medicine and never slacked off in learning.

To enrich their experience, the doctors were often asked to treat ordinary people as well. So, they became more respected and loved by everyone.

After more than ten years of Lán Yǎn’s service at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, Qīnghéng-Jūn ascended to the position of the sect leader, and his younger brother, Lán Qǐrén, was put in charge of the sect rules, as well as educating disciples.

Lán Yǎn had rarely seen the new leader, except when Qīnghéng-Jūn was young. The only times he had seen Qīnghéng-Jūn were during the important events that were held at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.

Qīnghéng-Jūn’s popularity was extraordinary. He was tall and graceful. He occasionally smiled despite being taciturn. And all his deeds were admirable.

Lán Yǎn had thought back then that he would have many interactions with the new leader. However, he didn't expect that Qīnghéng-Jūn would punish himself by going to seclusion for life.

Marrying someone who killed your shīfu* was really shocking. And, as a sect leader, how could he not impose such a severe punishment on himself?

<small>*The word ‘shīfu’ doesn’t have a counterpart in English. Sometimes, it is translated as ‘master’ or ‘teacher’, which is incorrect, because the bond between shīfu and his/her disciple is close to a parent-child relationship. While protecting his/her disciple, a shīfu passes on knowledge to them.</small>

Not long after getting married, and just before going to seclusion, Qīnghéng-Jūn said to Lán Yǎn, “My wife is in poor health condition. I hope you will take care of her illness.”

She was diagnosed as having bones damaged, which affected her cultivation. And Lán Yǎn had focused on delivering high-quality care for her.

Once, Lán Yǎn saw Qīnghéng-Jūn, with a gentle gaze in his eyes, quietly looking towards Jingshi, the dwelling where his wife was living. Lán Yǎn sighed and thought, “He never regrets his decision.”

Regularly, Lán Yǎn would take the pulse of Lady Qīnghéng. Perhaps it was because of a long confinement; Lady Qīnghéng was gradually becoming pale and placid, but she never complained. Quite the contrary, she often even had a smile on her face.

A few years later, the two jades of the GūsūLán clan were born, one after the other, on one hand. On the other hand, Lady Qīnghéng’s health condition got worse.

Since Lán Yǎn often paid visits to Lady Qīnghéng, he happened to meet the two gōngzǐ who came to see their mother.

They were looking identical and wearing the same clothes; however, because of their different temperaments, it was easy to distinguish them.

Lán XīChén always had a warm smile on his face, holding his taciturn young brother’s hand while heading to their mother’s dwelling.

And, together with his mother, they would chat and laugh. As for Lán WàngJī, no matter how much he was teased, he would remain silent.

Lán Yǎn would usually stand aside, looking at Lady Qīnghéng, who seemed not to be in good spirits, yet she would put on a brave face to tease her child.

When Lán WàngJī was six years old, Lady Qīnghéng couldn’t hold on much longer. And, after being gravely ill for two months, she passed away at the beginning of the winter.

Although she was under house arrest, still, she was the wife of the leader of the GūsūLán sect. And her funeral was modest but meticulously arranged.

Lán XīChén's eyes were red from crying, while Lán WàngJī remained quiet.

Three months after the funeral, it had been snowing heavily. And Lán Yǎn received a message saying that Lán WàngJī had a high fever and rushed to give him medical treatment.

Afterwards, Lán Yǎn learned that Lán WàngJī went alone to his mother’s dwelling, then sat in front of the door, waiting for his mother to open the door.

Lán Qǐrén and Lán XīChén had tried to persuade him many times not to go there, but to no avail. Since he was too young, he caught a cold due to the extreme weather condition.

Lán Yǎn couldn't bear to see him like this, so he said, “Èr-gōngzǐ, it’s easy to get sick in such cold weather; it’s better not to go there.”

Lán WàngJī looked at Lán Yǎn, then turned his head away without saying anything.
