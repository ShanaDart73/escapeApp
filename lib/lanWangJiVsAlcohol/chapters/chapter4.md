Jīn Líng said, “My uncle also said that among those three cases, there was a
woman who, as soon as she has regained consciousness, was asking after her
child.

“People close to her said that when she was in a confused state, she kept 
saying:
‘My child is dead’, but her child is safe and sound.

“It turns out that, in the past, she had lost a child. If we follow your
reasoning, it will mean that the woman must have been dreaming about the past
events.”

“It’s probably true,” said Lán SīZhuī, “Earlier, when JǐngYí had a bad dream, I
recognised the terrified expression on his face; it was the same expression he
had when he was frightened by a fierce corpse, which was hanging upside down
from the ceiling.

“JǐngYí, do you remember that time?”

Lán JǐngYí remained silent as if he was lost in thought.

Lán SīZhuī went on, “Since I couldn’t wake you up, I played Melody of Lucidity.
Then, when you got better, there was suddenly a smell of wine in the room. It
felt like resentful energy. So, I played an aggressive tune, and the smell
vanished.”

“Is that so?” said Lán JǐngYí, “So many things happened while I was sleeping.
Did HánGuāng-Jūn also see some terrifying event before losing consciousness?”

Suddenly, the room fell into dead silence, following Lán JǐngYí’s question.
Although it sounded improbable, however, Lán SīZhuī and Jīn Líng knew that it
was most likely to be the case.

As the other two remained silent, Lán JǐngYí scratched his head, wondering if he
had said something wrong.

He went on, “I can hardly imagine HánGuāng-Jūn being afraid of something.”

Jīn Líng frowned. He didn’t know what to say, and kept quiet.

Lán SīZhuī wanted to say something but he hesitated. He then dropped his gaze
and thought, “It’s not hard to imagine what HánGuāng-Jūn is afraid of.

“Throughout those thirteen years, after giving lessons, he would go Night
Hunting. And, late at night, after he finished correcting assignments, he would
stay quietly in his room, plucking at the strings of his guqin.

“When watching him, even all you could see was his back, you still could feel
his loneliness.

“So, whatever HánGuāng-Jūn had seen while he was in the cave must be related to
the same fear back then.

“However, this time, I am sure that HánGuāng-Jūn will be fine, because
Wèi-qiánbèi is by his side.”

... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

For the first time in his life, Wèi WúXiàn truly appreciated the existence of 
the 
three thousand rules of GūsūLán, especially the two that forbade their people: 
to talk behind someone’s back and to make noises, which helped him cope with 
the overwhelming embarrassment that he felt at this moment.

Running into two young disciples on their way back to Jingshi, Wèi WúXiàn hid
his face that had already turned red, as he saw that they were shocked but
didn’t dare to speak, only bowed their heads, and quickly moved away.

Wèi WúXiàn tried as much as he could to attract less attention to himself,
however, in the pale background of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, his iconic black clothes
was an eye-catching, let alone being in Lán WàngJī’s arms.

He thought, “Young boys, it’s not that I want to corrupt your innocence or
chastity. It’s just that I can’t handle Lán Zhàn when he is drunk. He is too
strong for me, and once he set up his mind to do something, he won’t give in, no
matter what.”

And, when he struggled to free himself from his arms, Lán WàngJī held him even
more tight, and looked at him with fondness. In his eyes, Wèi WúXiàn also read a
hint of sadness, that he could not bear, and eventually chose to indulge him.

Then, Wèi WúXiàn begged him to walk much faster, so that they could quickly
reach their dwelling. However, much to his surprise, Lán WàngJī did just the
opposite; slowing down his pace, and taking all his time.

Furthermore, Lán WàngJī seemed to have made a long detour, passing by the
locations where there were usually many people, such as the front of Orchid
Room*.

<small>*Orchid Room is the name of GūsūLán classroom.</small>

Wèi WúXiàn put a hand on his forehead and thought, “Oh my! How did it slip my
mind that when Lán Zhàn is drunk, he turns a deaf ear to everything that he
doesn’t want to hear?”

Fortunately, there was no lecture today, and most of the disciples, included
those from other sects who came to study at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, were in the
library. Only a few youngsters were outside, walking around.

The only two things that Wèi WúXiàn could do were submissively letting Lán
WàngJī carry him, and patiently waiting for them to reach Jingshi.

With a dignified expression on his face, Lán WàngJī walked slowly on the paved
paths of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù. And, occasionally, when Wèi WúXiàn stirred in his
arms, he would stopped walking, looked at him with tenderness, then resumed
walking.

Wèi WúXiàn had leaned his head against Lán WàngJī’s shoulder, and the gentle
fragrance of sandalwood emanated from Lán WàngJī wrapped around him.

He started to look at Lán WàngJī’s white and graceful neck, then up to the
smooth curve of his jaws, and then, his eyes lingered at Lán WàngJī’s profile,
while thinking that he would never get tired of looking at his face.

Then, as some Lán WàngJī’s long hair had slipped in front, Wèi WúXiàn began to
twist it with his fingers.

As he carried on fiddling with Lán WàngJī’s hair, Wèi WúXiàn replayed Lán
WàngJī’s behaviour in his mind; each time they met some disciples on their way;
he would stop and wait for them to bow, and walk away with a surprising
expression on their faces.

Wèi WúXiàn’s lips curved into a smile while rerunning those scenes in his head.

His facial expression seemed to reflect a feeling of satisfaction. The more Wèi
WúXiàn thought about Lán WàngJī’s behaviour, the cuter he looked.

Lán WàngJī noticed the warm smile of Wèi WúXiàn. He stopped, looked at him, and
smiled as well. This time, there was no trace of sadness in his crystal-like
eyes,

Wèi WúXiàn blinked, because he wasn’t sure if Lán WàngJī was still drunk. So, he
held up two fingers in front of Lán WàngJī and asked, “Èr-gēge, how many
fingers?”

The first thing that crossed Lán WàngJī’s mind was to grab Wèi WúXiàn’s fingers
with his both hands. However, he realised that if he did so, it would require
him to let go of Wèi WúXiàn, which he definitely didn’t want to do. So, he
replied, “Two.”

Wèi WúXiàn read him like an open book, and suppressed a chuckle, he then said,
“Well done! Here, I’ll give you a reward.”

In a coquettish manner, Wèi WúXiàn wrapped his arms around Lán WàngJī’s neck,
and kissed him on the cheek.

Lán WàngJī’s heart skipped a beat, his eyes widened, his ears turned red, and
his Adam’s apple bobbed up and down.

Wèi WúXiàn amusingly thought, “As time goes by, it’s getting harder to see this
reaction when I tease Lán Èr-gōngzǐ*. But now that he is drunk not only he
becomes frank and stubborn, but also he has this innocent expression of a
teenager. This is quite interesting.”

<small>*gōngzǐ is an honorific title for a son of a noble family.</small>

Very excited, Wèi WúXiàn, in a teasing way, asked, “Why, all of a sudden, do you
become so timid?” Then, since Lán WàngJī didn’t react, he said, “If that is so,
then put me down.”

At the moment he heard Wèi WúXiàn’s last words, Lán WàngJī pulled himself
together, held him even more tight, and loudly said, “I won’t.”

Then, he seemed to remember that it was not allowed to raise one’s voice, which
caused him to be embarrassed. And, as a result, he began to walk much faster.

Wèi WúXiàn was delighted by that result, then he said, “Not bad at all. Hurry
up, or else——”

Instead of completing his sentence, Wèi WúXiàn moved his head close to his, then
kissed Lán WàngJī’s earlobe.

Lán WàngJī almost stumbled, he stopped to establish his balance, then resumed
walking. His pace was as fast as the wind, causing his white clothes to flutter.

Then, he heard Wèi WúXiàn whispering to his ear, “If you don’t hurry up, I’ll
keep kissing you until we reach Jingshi.”

<br />&nbsp;
... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

Some disciples who were coming out of the library saw, like a comet crossing the sky, a bright light produced by the silver sword, heading towards Jingshi, and was accompanied by a melodious laughter, which was very heartwarming.

<br />&nbsp;
... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

Lán WàngJī’s heart was beating very fast, and despite the layers of his high quality clothes, the throb of his heartbeat could not be concealed, and were easy sensed by Wèi WúXiàn.

Looking at Lán WàngJī who was desperately rushing towards their room at a high
speed, because he was aroused by him, Wèi WúXiàn smile froze, thinking that he
might have gone too far this time. But there was no other way.

On top of that, every time when he saw Lán WàngJī who was usually calm and
well-mannered losing control of himself because of him, Wèi WúXiàn could not
help but keep teasing him.

And, each time it happened, Wèi WúXiàn was like seized by a feeling of a great
accomplishment, he thought, “Lán Zhàn’s current state of arousal is caused by
me.”

After saying that to himself, all traces of guilt were swept away from his face.
He even licked his lips with excitement.

Lán WàngJī seemed to have reached his limit. As soon as he landed, he grabbed
his sword, then, on second thought, he threw the top-grade spiritual sword on
the ground without ceremony, thinking that it was too much of a hindrance.

Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes widened in surprise. Then, he pretended to be shocked and
said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, don’t you want Bìchén* any longer? Why are you in such a
rush?”

<small>*Bìchén is the name of Lán WàngJī’s sword.</small>

Without paying attention to what Wèi WúXiàn was saying, Lán WàngJī stormed into
the room, and carried him straight to the bedroom. Immediately after he laid Wèi
WúXiàn on the bed, Lán WàngJī also got on the bed with his body pressed down on
Wèi WúXiàn’s body.

Lán WàngJī was breathing heavily, while trying to control his sexual urge.
Meanwhile, Wèi WúXiàn was getting turned on by Lán WàngJī’s warm breath brushing
the soft skin of his neck.

He put his hands on Lán WàngJī’s back, and began gentle to run his fingers. Now
that he was no longer worried about Lán WàngJī’s condition, Wèi WúXiàn wanted to
be held tight.

Even if Lán WàngJī held him too tight to the point of feeling pain, it was
preferable than to see him lying unconscious in the bed.

Inhaling the usual fragrance of sandalwood, Wèi WúXiàn let out a long sigh of
relief, then, he whispered on Lán WàngJī’s ear, “Lán Zhàn, next time, don’t do
this so suddenly, I——”

Wèi WúXiàn interrupted himself as he saw Lán WàngJī raising his head to look at
him. He noted that Lán WàngJī’s ears were still red, however, he was no longer
in a hurry to hold him like he usually did.

Lán WàngJī’s golden eyes were fixed at Wèi WúXiàn intensely, as though he wanted
to know if it was okay for him to carry on holding him.

Wèi WúXiàn’s feeling of uneasiness came back to his mind. He had a gut feeling
that something was not quite right with Lán WàngJī. He looked at him with a
puzzled expression in his face, then, he called out, “Lán Zhàn?”

At that instant, Lán WàngJī began to stroke Wèi WúXiàn hair, then brush one of
his eyebrows, he carried on caressing Wèi WúXiàn’s cheek, and then, his slender
fingers touched Wèi WúXiàn’s slightly parted, sensual lips.

At the moment he run his fingers on Wèi WúXiàn’s lips, Lán WàngJī suddenly
stopped, and the rhythm of his breathing became chaotic.

Wèi WúXiàn was now certain that something was definitely wrong with Lán WàngJī.

Usually, he would kiss and hold him without hesitation. After all, they were a
couple, and had an intimate relationship.

It was not like at the beginning of their relationship when, sometimes, Lán
WàngJī would show some hesitation or shyness in touching Wèi WúXiàn.

Furthermore, when Lán WàngJī was drunk, he wouldn’t hesitate even for an instant
to kiss Wèi WúXiàn earnestly. Dominant, he wouldn’t let Wèi WúXiàn escape from
his hold.

So, why did he, even being drunk, become hesitant?

“Wait a minute!” Wèi WúXiàn seemed to think hard, “The way Lán Zhàn hugged me
inside the cave, and the look on his face when he stared at me were strange.
And, earlier, when he held me in the sitting room of Lán Lǎo, could it be
that——”

Putting his both hands against Lán WàngJī’s chest, Wèi WúXiàn began, “Lán Zhàn,
are you——”

Without warning, Lán WàngJī interrupted Wèi WúXiàn with a sudden kiss. And the
latter could easily feel that Lán WàngJī was trembling uncontrollably.

Then, as if he was afraid that Wèi WúXiàn would resist him, Lán WàngJī firmly
wrapped his arm around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist, while his other hand held the back of
Wèi WúXiàn’s head.

Lán WàngJī’s kisses were first gentle, then quickly became more intense, showing
his fierce desire. He kissed Wèi WúXiàn with passion and fury, and, like always,
making him unable to resist his caress.

Wèi WúXiàn didn’t expect to be kissed so suddenly, and in the way Lán WàngJī
usually kissed him.

However, he held him more tight than usual that Wèi WúXiàn could barely move. He
managed to free his arms, and wrapped them around Lán WàngJī’s shoulders.

But Lán WàngJī misunderstood his gesture, thinking that Wèi WúXiàn was trying to
resist him, and pressed down on Wèi WúXiàn’s body even more.

Wèi WúXiàn found it difficult to breath under Lán WàngJī’s strong embrace. He
let out weak sound of pain, however, since his mouth was covered by Lán WàngJī’s
kisses, it sounded like a lustful moan.

As a result, Lán WàngJī became even more enticed by the moan, sucking Wèi
WúXiàn’s tongue, twisting his own tongue around his fiercely.

Lán WàngJī’s tongue was hot and insatiable, sweeping each inch of Wèi WúXiàn’s
mouth in a voracious way. Their both lips kept on intertwining, while their
heads tossing and turning continuously.

Wèi WúXiàn found it harder and harder to breathe properly. Being out of breath,
Wèi WúXiàn’s chest was moving up and down rapidly. His grip around Lán WàngJī’s
shoulders loosed, and his arms began slowly to slide down.

Lack of sleep and adequate breathing caused Wèi WúXiàn to suddenly feel dizzy,
and his whole body gradually became weak.

Lán WàngJī noticed the change on Wèi WúXiàn, and withdrew his tongue from his
mouth. Then, he began gently to lick Wèi WúXiàn’s lips to let him catch his
breath.

As was his habit, Lán WàngJī bit Wèi WúXiàn’s lower lip, which was slightly
swollen by his intense kisses. Then, he raised his head to look at Wèi WúXiàn
who became so horny that his facial expression caused sexual arousal.
