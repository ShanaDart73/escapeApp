Since the bathtub was deformed and water was still in it, it was awkward for Lán
WàngJī to carry it. So, from where they were, Lán XīChén and Jiāng Chéng saw a
moving bathtub, which was a strange sight, until Lán WàngJī turned around to
close the door and walked away.

In astonishment, Jiāng Chéng stared at Lán WàngJī, who usually looked elegant
and dignified, holding a bathtub that was comically oversized, causing him to
forget temporarily why he was there in the first place.

As he noticed the shocking expression on Jiāng Chéng’s face, Lán XīChén said,
“Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ, please forgive this sorry sight. WàngJī is still intoxicated
and not behaving as he normally would.”

Jiāng Chéng looked puzzled. How could Lán WàngJī get drunk when GūsūLán’s rules
prohibited drinking alcohol.

Lán XīChén then explained, “WàngJī has been affected by the smell of wine while
they were out on their Night Hunting.”

Surprised, Jiāng Chéng exclaimed, “HánGuāng-Jūn is drunk because the smell of
alcohol! What about Wèi WúXiàn? Is he all right?”

“Of course, I’m fine.”

Wèi WúXiàn was standing in the doorway, rubbing his lower back, then walked
forward with somewhat unsteady steps.

Jiāng Chéng observed him for a while, and suddenly, he frowned angrily, without
uttering a single word.

As he noticed the change in Jiāng Chéng’s mood, Wèi WúXiàn immediately came to a
halt.

He was already aware of the two them standing outside, but Lán WàngJī didn’t
want him to come out because his whole body was aching. However, when he heard
Jiāng Chéng asking about him with concern, he hurriedly put on his outer robe
and opened the door.

Wèi WúXiàn thought, “Just now, his facial expression was fine, why does he
suddenly seem angry? Did Jīn Líng say something about me that got him upset?”

Jiāng Chéng had all the reason to get angry. After learning that Wèi WúXiàn was
‘injured’, he rushed over here. He even threatened a GūsūLán disciple.

When he finally saw Wèi WúXiàn, Jiāng Chéng noted that he had a dishevelled
appearance: his eyes were red; he seemed to be drained of all his strength; and
his neck was covered in love bites to the point that it became awkward to look
at him.

In an irritable mood, Jiāng Chéng thought, “Do I have nothing better to do than
listening to Jīn Líng’s nonsense?”

At Jīnlíntái, a young boy snoozes twice* loudly.

<small>*In Chinese culture, sneezing once means: someone is missing you, twice:
someone is cursing you, and three times: someone is in love with you.</small>

Lán XīChén thought about leaving but couldn’t, because Jiāng Chéng’s mood had
changed drastically.

At that moment, Lán WàngJī, who had returned, walked quietly forward and stood
in front of Wèi WúXiàn, blocking Jiāng Chéng’s view of him.

It was easy to see that Lán WàngJī did it on purpose, which caused Jiāng Chéng
to fume. He slowly uttered, “Lán WàngJī!”

In a very cold tone, Lán WàngJī retorted, “Jiāng WǎnYín*!”

<small>*Jiāng WǎnYín is Jiāng Chéng’s given name (rarely mentioned).</small>

The air between them thickened under the weight of their spiritual energies,
which pressed against each other in open conflict. Now and then, tiny sparks of
lightning crackled where the powers collided.

Lán XīChén thought that this situation was not optimistic.

Wèi WúXiàn gently tugged at Lán WàngJī’s sleeve, wanting to coax him to calm
down.

Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí, who just arrived, were shocked by the scene, as well
as surprised to see that Lán XīChén was there too.

After they saluted Lán XīChén, Lán JǐngYí said angrily, “Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ,
Wèi-qiánbèi has never provoked or offended you in any way. Since Zéwú-Jūn is
here as well, why don’t you all have a good talk together instead?”

“JǐngYí!” Lán SīZhuī scolded him, then observed that the situation seemed not to
be like he had initially thought.

Wèi WúXiàn was confused by Lán JǐngYí’s words, wondering what Jiāng Chéng wanted
to say to him. However, as he sensed Lán WàngJī’s spiritual pressure became more
intense, Wèi WúXiàn quickly brought his attention back to him, he said, “Lán
Zhàn, Jiāng Chéng has no ill intentions.”

But Lán WàngJī didn’t respond. So Wèi WúXiàn tried again this time by holding
his hand and gently shook it.

Finally, Lán WàngJī restrained his spiritual pressure, turned around and looked
at Wèi WúXiàn with tenderness.

Jiāng Chéng hated it when these two displayed their affection in his presence.
Just as he was about to say something, he saw Lán WàngJī hug Wèi WúXiàn and kiss
him in front of everyone.

The kissing scene caused a shock to everyone. Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí’s faces
flushed instantly, they hurriedly lowered their heads, daring not to look at the
two lovers.

Wèi WúXiàn lost count of how many times Lán WàngJī caught him off guard.

Three years ago, at Lotus Piers, Jiāng Chéng had seen him hug Lán WàngJī under
the tree. Since then, Wèi WúXiàn had been careful, taking Lán WàngJī’s
reputation into consideration.

However, in just one day, all his efforts were ruined because of Lán WàngJī
being drunk. Moreover, it happened in front of Jiāng Chéng once again.

Wèi WúXiàn’s cheeks took on a pink tint. His hand pressed to his forehead, Wèi
WúXiàn was certain that Lán WàngJī had done it on purpose, convinced that he
shouldn’t be let out while he was drunk.

“I have to say something, otherwise a fight between them will break out,”
thought Wèi WúXiàn.

Trying hard to ignore the eyes on him, especially Jiāng Chéng’s glare, Wèi
WúXiàn swallowed hard, met Lán WàngJī’s gaze, and began, “Lán Zhàn, I think——”

“Don’t say it!” Lán WàngJī interrupted him.

“Ah?” Wèi WúXiàn got puzzled.

Still holding Wèi WúXiàn in his arms, unwilling to let him go, Lán WàngJī said
angrily, “Don’t say his name.”

It was clear to everyone that Lán WàngJī was referring to Jiāng Chéng. And Wèi
WúXiàn felt helpless as he noticed a flash of purple light.

Lán WàngJī’s words got Jiāng Chéng very upset that he could no longer restrain
himself.

Back then, when they were teenagers, although Jiāng Chéng admired Lán WàngJī, he
didn’t think that they would interact with each other in the future.

Likewise, he never imagined that a day would come when Wèi WúXiàn would leave
Lotus Piers, where he was raised, become Lán WàngJī’s partner, and live in
Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, a place he once despised because of their strict rules.

After everything was settled down, Jiāng Chéng never expected he would rashly
break into Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù for Wèi WúXiàn’s sake, and want to fight with Lán
WàngJī.

As he sensed Jiāng Chéng’s fighting aura, Lán WàngJī let go of Wèi WúXiàn and,
while turning around, made sure that Wèi WúXiàn stayed behind him, then he
summoned Bìchén.

The spiritual energy of the sword flowed through its body, the edges shone
brightly, and a faint sound of a dragon’s roar was emitted.

Lán WàngJī stood tall and majestic, his white clothes began to flutter as though
it was caused by the strong wind, and his spiritual energy became overwhelming.

As this point, Lán XīChén could no longer stand by and watch. He hurried forward
and said, “Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ, please don’t mind WàngJī’s words when he is under the
influence of alcohol. Furthermore, here is Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, so think twice.”

Jiāng Chéng sneered, “Zéwú-Jūn, since I’ve dared to trespass on your property, I
no longer care about the consequences.”

Lán WàngJī stepped forward and said, “Xiōng-zhǎng, there’s no need to talk to
him.”

Then he slowly turned his head and glared at Jiāng Chéng, he said coldly, “There
must be a fight between you and me.”

With anxiety, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, wait!”

However, the two of them had already reached the point of no return. They
launched their attacks simultaneously, and Zǐdiàn and Bìchén collided violently,
producing the deafening sound of an explosion.

The impact of their spiritual energies distorted the surrounding air, creating
waves that swept the area with an overwhelming pressure.

Standing nearby, Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí couldn’t dodge on time and, since
their cultivation levels were not as strong as theirs, they were instantly
affected: their ears were ringing and their hearts were pumping fast.

Lán SīZhuī tried hard to hold back the blood that was about to come out of his
mouth. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Wèi WúXiàn stagger backwards onto
his feet, which alarmed him. He then rushed over and held Wèi WúXiàn by the arm,
he asked, “Wèi-qiánbèi, are you all right?”

In normal circumstances, Wèi WúXiàn wouldn’t be thrown off balance by the
aftermath. He was extremely exhausted due to their intense activity in the
bathtub and, later on, because of his nightmare, he didn’t sleep much.
Therefore, he hadn’t recovered all his strength.

Wèi WúXiàn patted Lán SīZhuī’s hand, signalling him that he was fine. Then, by
observing the two men venting their anger and frustration, he predicted the
outcome the fight.

Lán WàngJī had always harboured a grudge against Jiāng Chéng. If he were not
drunk and for Jīn Líng’s sake, he would restrain himself.

However, right now, it wasn’t the case. Lán WàngJī gave free rein to his
emotions and didn’t hold back on his attacks, which were incredibly powerful.

On the other hand, Jiāng Chéng’s bark was worse than his bite. He was a
soft-hearted person and didn’t use any ruthless moves. It was only a matter of
time before he got defeated.

While he was fighting Lán WàngJī, from time to time, Jiāng Chéng couldn’t help
but look in the direction of Wèi WúXiàn to check on his condition.

Lán XīChén looked at Wèi WúXiàn in his eyes and nodded.

Wèi WúXiàn immediately understood Lán XīChén’s intention and, patting Lán
SīZhuī’s shoulder, he said, “SīZhuī, take JǐngYí and go far from here. Make sure
that no one comes this way.”

Lán SīZhuī worriedly said, “But Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ and HánGuāng-Jūn are fighting.”

As pulled off Chénqíng from his waist-band, Wèi WúXiàn replied with smile,
“Don’t worry. Even though HánGuāng-Jūn is drunk, he will never hurt me. Besides,
Zéwú-Jūn is also here. So, hurry up. If uncle happens to know about this, we
will be in trouble.”

Indeed, if Lán Lǎo found out, the consequences would be unimaginable. Without
further delay, Lán SīZhuī did as he was told.

Choosing the right timing, Wèi WúXiàn rushed and stood between Lán WàngJī and
Jiāng Chéng.

As soon as Wèi WúXiàn appeared in front of each of them, they at once retracted
their attacks. However, their spiritual energies couldn’t be stopped.

Lán XīChén drew Shuòyuè and neutralised Jiāng Chéng’s purple lightning. Wèi
WúXiàn used Chénqíng to block Lán WàngJī’s spiritual pressure, but since he was
in poor condition, he stumbled backwards before steadying himself.

Lán WàngJī was startled. He hurried over and held Wèi WúXiàn in his arms. As he
was about to transfer his spiritual energy to him through the wrist, he saw Wèi
WúXiàn smile at him and stop him from doing so.

Jiāng Chéng was already alarmed when he saw Wèi WúXiàn stagger backwards.
However, his emotions became even worse when he saw Lán WàngJī ready to channel
his spiritual energy to Wèi WúXiàn. He felt like being struck by lightning, as
something had suddenly crossed his mind.
