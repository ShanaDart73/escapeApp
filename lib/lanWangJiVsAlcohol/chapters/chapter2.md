When the teenagers went Night Hunting with Wèi WúXiàn, they usually
joked around to make them feel less nervous. This time, however,
Lán WàngJī was there as well, so the atmosphere was intense.

Lán JǐngYí was a little bit anxious, thinking that if he didn’t perform well he
would definitely be punished later on. After unsheathing his sword, he entered
the monster’s lair.

Wèi WúXiàn had reminded him before getting inside the lair that if he noticed
any anomaly, he should at once send the signal.

Although the monster’s level of cultivation was not high, they must not drop
their guard, because this was the first time they encountered a monster that
used wine to lure people.

Some time had elapsed since Lán JǐngYí went in, and no sound of fighting had
been heard either.

So, Lán WàngJī used his spiritual energy to probe the lair, then, frowning
slightly, he said, “I didn’t detect the sound of his footsteps.”

“No sound of JǐngYí’s footsteps?” thought Wèi WúXiàn, “Something must have
stopped him from moving forward.”

Seeing that Lán WàngJī was about to enter the lair, Wèi WúXiàn stopped him by
saying, “Lán Zhàn, the inside of the monster’s lair must be very dusty. It would
be a shame if your white clothes get dirty. Leave it to me.” Then, he bent and
entered the lair.

Jīn Líng decided to follow suit after thinking that he was there to learn and
practise, so he couldn’t just stay there watching and do nothing.

As soon as he penetrated into the lair, Wèi WúXiàn was welcomed with a very
strong aroma of wine.

The smell was so extreme that it made even a wine lover like Wèi WúXiàn feel
suffocated.
As for Jīn Líng, he could not suppress a series of coughs.

Instinctively, Wèi WúXiàn felt that he had been targeted. He at once threw three
talismans in front of him, and said, “Jīn Líng, find JǐngYí and carry him
outside.”

An angry roar came from where the talismans struck, then the red light produced
by the talismans revealed where the monster was.

A smirk appeared on Wèi WúXiàn’s face while looking at the monster, he resumed,
“Don’t let Lán Zhàn or Lán SīZhuī get here, because they are not good at
drinking. If they breathe this strong smell of alcohol, they will definitely
faint.”

Then, at leisure, he moved forward to confront the monster.

Jīn Líng began to cast about and find Lán JǐngYí close by, lying on the ground.
He noticed that Lán JǐngYí had fainted, and could not help but roll his eyes.

He then made Lán JǐngYí stand up by supporting him, so he could drag him out of
the lair. As he began to move, Jīn Líng felt that something was preventing him
from dragging Lán JǐngYí.

He suddenly realised that Lán JǐngYí’s ankle was grabbed by something. Alarmed,
Jīn Líng hit that thing with his palm. His attack made that thing to move
backwards.

He then drew Suìhuá* and swung it horizontally while still supporting Lán
JǐngYí. His sword produced a bright light that illuminated his surroundings.

<small>*Suìhuá is the name of Jīn Líng’s sword.</small>

Seeing who were his opponents, Jīn Líng’s eyes widened in surprise;
unexpectedly, there were common people inside the lair of the monster!

He also noticed that they didn’t act of their own free will, they seemed to be
manipulated to attack him. And, since they were common people, Jīn Líng knew
that he could not use Suìhuá against them.

So, he calmed himself down, sheathed his sword, and started to kick away those
who were getting close to attack him.

To his surprise, Jīn Líng noted that they seemed not to feel pain at all, and
kept coming towards him.

To avoid hurting those people, Jīn Líng was not using his full strength.
However, after a while, he felt that the situation was hopeless.

Wèi WúXiàn also had to deal with many puppets, while the monster was hiding
itself behind them.

However, the talismans on the monster’s body helped Wèi WúXiàn to locate it. It
was just a matter of time before it got caught.

A red light flashed from Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes, as he narrowed them. And, all of a
sudden, the inside of the lair became eerie; Wèi WúXiàn had summoned dark energy
along with demons. And, like a rope, that energy tied up all those puppets.

Jīn Líng let out a sigh of relief, then he asked, “Why are there so many common
people in here, as well as the souls of dead people?”

Wèi WúXiàn laughed, then replied, “That’s because there are so many drunkards.”

While joking, Wèi WúXiàn was actually using Chénqíng* to also control countless
dead people’s souls, so that he could stop them from roaming inside the lair,
and, peacefully, dispatch them from this world.

<small>*Chénqíng is the name of Wèi WúXiàn’s flute.</small>

After a quick observation, Wèi WúXiàn came to the conclusion that the presence
of those souls indicated that many people had be killed here by the monster,
while those who were still alive must have been brought here recently.

Also, the smell of the corpses had been overpowered by the strong smell of the
wine. No wonder Wèi WúXiàn didn’t detect any smell of those who were slaughtered
by the monster.

“Tut,” thought Wèi WúXiàn, “This is the first time I find that the smell of
alcohol can also be disgusting.”

Then, skilfully spinning Chénqíng between his fingers, which, in turn,
gracefully swayed the red tassel attached at one end of the flute, Wèi WúXiàn
got close to the monster that was now held down by the dark energy.

He said, “It’s rare to see a monster that can brew wine. I would love to capture
you alive, and study your abilities. But——”

Wèi WúXiàn paused, and then waved Chénqíng. As a result, the dark energy
strangled the monster until the sound of the broken bones could be heard.

In a cold tone, he resumed, “it’s pity that you have done too much of evil
deeds.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the demons, which were summoned and waiting for
that moment, rushed to devour the monster. And, the very next instant, there was
nothing left of it.

Wèi WúXiàn then joined Jīn Líng, and, with a smile on his face, he asked, “Are
you scared?”

“I... I’m not scared.” Jīn Líng quickly replied.

“If you are not scared, why are you still standing here, then?” Wèi WúXiàn
asked.

Jīn Líng replied, “That’s because Lán JǐngYí is too heavy.”

Wèi WúXiàn shook his head helplessly and said, “If you can’t even handle his
weight, then, you will need to practise harder.”

Then, he turned around and glanced at those people who were now looking like the
zombies. He suddenly felt gloomy just by observing their states.

“I can’t use Chénqíng to control the living being,” he thought, “If I do, in
order to guide them out of the lair, I’m afraid that it would damage their
brains.”

He went on, “If I want to bring them to their senses, I will need Lán Zhàn to
play his Melody of Lucidity.”

After pondering for a short while, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Jīn Líng, ask Lán Zhàn to
expand the entrance in order to let the fresh air in, and the smell of the wine
out. Meanwhile, I will explore the cave.”

Soon after Jīn Líng left the lair dragging the unconscious Lán JǐngYí, Wèi
WúXiàn heard a continuous sound of a sword hitting the entrance of the cave.

He cautiously lit a touch. He didn’t do it before because he was afraid that it
might cause an explosion due to the smell of the alcohol in the air.

As he surveyed the inside of the lair, Wèi WúXiàn found hundreds of jars
containing wine. “No wonder there is a lasting smell of alcohol inside the
cave,” he said.

He went on, “In order to find out what is wrong with this wine, I should take a
few jars to study the wine later on, when we get back home.”

As he was about to pick up a jar, Wèi WúXiàn felt like something brushed his
fingers, and he quickly reacted by moving a few steps backwards.

Then, in front of him, he saw a little creature jumped out from a jar, and
rushed towards him. At the same time, other little creatures, one by one, were
coming out of their respective jars.

As they did so, the jars lost balance, knocking the adjacent ones, and, one
after another, they crashed on the ground, with a continuous loud smash.

Some of the jars that contained wine fell on the ground as well, which released
more smell of alcohol inside the lair.

“This cave is actually a den of monsters!” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, “That monster
had in fact gave birth to such a larger group of offspring!”

There was no time to ponder. After extinguishing the touch, Wèi WúXiàn quickly
played some notes on his flute with the intention of catching them all at once.

Meanwhile, after listening to Jīn Líng’s account, checking Lán JǐngYí’s
condition, and asking Lán SīZhuī to play Melody of Lucidity to wake him up, Lán
WàngJī widened the entrance of the lair, and was now waiting for the smell of
wine to dissipate, when, all of a sudden, he heard the piercing sound of
Chénqíng.

Before Jīn Líng could stop him, Lán WàngJī, alarmed, rushed into the cave.

Since the smell of the alcohol inside the lair had become more stronger than
before, due to the wine that splashed onto the floor, Lán WàngJī felt a sudden
splitting headache just by inhaling the smell.

He shook his head, trying to suppress the pain, then quickly moved further down
the cave.

In the darkness, Lán WàngJī discerned countless of pairs of green eyes, which
surrounded the slender figure blowing into the flute.

Seized with terror, Lán WàngJī summoned WàngJī*, and quickly strummed his
fingers on the guqin, which caused the seven strings to vibrate violently.

<small>*WàngJī is the name of Lán WàngJī’s guqin.</small>

Like a weapon, the sound emitted by WàngJī caused those little monsters to howl
in pain.

Wèi WúXiàn was not only startled but also noticed that something was not quite
right with the notes that Lán WàngJī produced.

As he turned around, he saw Lán WàngJī, who was almost running towards him,
then, he held him tight in his arms.

While hugging Wèi WúXiàn, Lán WàngJī, in silence, was gritting his teeth, with a
frown between his eyebrows.

Noting that something was wrong with Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn became worried, and
tried to free himself from his hug in order to examine him carefully, but
failed.

Then, all of a sudden, Lán WàngJī raised his head, and slowly looked around,
then fixed his gaze at Wèi WúXiàn.

Wèi WúXiàn recognised the look on Lán WàngJī’s face. It was the same look that
Lán WàngJī had, from time to time, when he woke up from a nightmare.

When it happened, Lán WàngJī would desperately hold him tight, and then, he
would gaze at him in daze, with that look on his face.

“Lán Zhàn?” in a low voice, Wèi WúXiàn called.

With his lips slightly trembling, Lán WàngJī was still looking at him in stupor.

Then, suddenly, he turned around, shielded Wèi WúXiàn with his body, summoned
WàngJī once again, and, this time, he produced some blue spiritual strings that
pierced through the darkness.

The blue strings hit the wall of the cave, and blew up some segment of the wall.

Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly stopped him from striking again, because, if he carried on
like this, the cave would collapsed, while those common people were still
inside.

In a soothing tone, Wèi WúXiàn began, “Lán Zhàn, everything is all right now,
those little monsters are already——” he suddenly paused, noticing that something
was off.

Then, he realised that Lán WàngJī just passed out, and quickly held him so to
prevent him from falling on the ground.

Outside the cave, Lán WàngJī’s attacks were felt as if it was an earthquake,
shaking the ground violently. The vibration was so great that it made Lán JǐngYí
wake up faster than the notes of Melody of Lucidity.

Worried, Lán SīZhuī ran towards the entrance of the cave. However, before he
could reach the entrance, Wèi WúXiàn rushed out of the cave, carrying Lán WàngJī
on his back.
Looking at the current state of Lán WàngJī, the three teenagers were at a loss.

Without further delay, Wèi WúXiàn told Jīn Líng and Lán JǐngYí to take care of
the common people who were still inside the cave.

And, since he could no longer use his sword, Wèi WúXiàn asked Lán SīZhuī to
drive them back to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.

<br />&nbsp;
... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

Although not many people in Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù knew about Lán WàngJī’s condition,
however, the matter was far to be trivial.

Also, when they were back at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, the three teenagers, who didn’t
know the details of what happened inside the cave, were even restless, while
waiting outside Jingshi before being sent away.

Right now, however, this unexpected turn of events caught Wèi WúXiàn and Lán
XīChén off guard. Just a moment ago, they were worried while nursing the
comatose Lán WàngJī.

They didn’t expect him to suddenly wake up, let alone to behave like this;
hugging his partner in front his uncle and brother, and refusing to let go of
him.

Lán Qǐrén frowned, as if he could not believe his eyes, and said, “How can he be
in such a state just by the smell of wine?”

“Uncle, although it sounds unbelievable, however, WàngJī’s case is an
exception,” Lán XīChén said, “It’s pity that WàngJī killed all the little
monsters, and smashed all the jars that were filled with wine. Otherwise, we
might have found some clues.”

While stroking his goatee, Lán Qǐrén thought for a moment, then asked, “Have
those people who were rescued regained consciousness?”

“No, they’re still in state of stupor,” replied Lán XīChén, “Now right, our
doctor is giving them medical treatment.”

Lán Qǐrén nodded, and said, “In that case, when they recover their senses,
listen to their accounts to see if you can learn more about this matter.”

Then, he looked at Wèi WúXiàn who was hugged by his nephew. The scene was really
awkward, no matter how you looked at it, and causing the veins of his temples to
throb.

He said, “Wèi Yīng, take WàngJī back to have some rest. And, for the time being,
there is no need for him to give lessons.”

Wèi WúXiàn couldn’t agree more with what Lán Qǐrén just said, and hurriedly
nodded his head.

While turning to look at Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn was thinking that, once they
returned to Jingshi, he would let Lán WàngJī do whatever he wanted, indulging
him like a spoiled child.

There would be no one around to watch them, and Lán WàngJī could take the
advantage of being drunk to let himself go, doing what he wouldn’t normally dare
to do.

With difficulty, Wèi WúXiàn managed to free himself from Lán WàngJī’s grip
around his waist, then, he smiled at him, and said, “Lán Zhàn, uncle said that
we can go back to——”

Wèi WúXiàn interrupted himself to listen to Lán WàngJī, who muttered, “Huh ...
What ...?”

However, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t hear every word that Lán WàngJī said.

In the meantime, Lán Qǐrén felt suffocated just by watching them sitting so
close together, and whispering to each other.

And, when he was about to say something, Wèi WúXiàn asked in a coaxing voice,
“Lán Zhàn, what did you said? Can you speak louder?”
