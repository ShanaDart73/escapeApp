After filling the bathtub, Wèi WúXiàn dipped his hand into the bathwater to
check the temperature. Satisfied, he then rolled up the sleeves of his white
robe, which revealed the smoothness of the skin of his arms.

The robe was of a thin fabric that was slightly larger at the shoulders, and it
was tied around his slender waist, making him look thin and delicate.

Wèi WúXiàn looked at Lán WàngJī, and noted that the latter was feverishly
watching every single part of his body, which made him feel a little bit hot.

With a smile on his face, he said, “Èr-gēge, get into the bathtub, I’ll help you
clean off the dust on your body.”

However, Lán WàngJī spread his arms instead, letting Wèi WúXiàn know that he
wanted him to remove the last inner robe, as well.

Wèi WúXiàn was amused, and, of course, he was delighted to do whatever his
beloved husband wanted him to do.

While helping him remove his robe, Wèi WúXiàn said inwardly, “Lán Zhàn likes
being clean all the time. After the incident that happened in the monster’s
lair, we have been covered with dust.”

“However,” he went on, “since I was really concerned about his condition, it
didn’t cross my mind to even change clothes, let alone taking a bath.”

After Lán WàngJī got into the bathtub, Wèi WúXiàn brush back his long and silky
hair, took a soft cloth, soaked it with the bathwater, and then, he began gently
to wash the beautiful face of his hubby.

In order to make Wèi WúXiàn’s task easier, Lán WàngJī raised his head while he
kept his eyes closed.

Since he was looking younger than his age, Lán WàngJī’s skin was white and
smooth. This was due to the immortality cultivation that enabled cultivators to
maintain their youthful appearance.

Not only he looked younger, but also his arched eyebrows were perfectly shaped,
his long eyelashes were beautifully curled, with some thin droplets of water
were hanging on them, the eyelashes appeared to be even more gorgeous.

When his eyes were opened, one could see that they were as clear and pure as a
crystal ball, just like those of Wèi WúXiàn, unclouded by even a speck of dust.

Maybe because the mood at that precise moment was so calm and pleasant, that his
body was relaxed, and that his mind was at ease, that, all of a sudden, Wèi
WúXiàn yearned to get as close as one could be to Lán WàngJī.

Gazing at the face that was pleasing to eye, Wèi WúXiàn became a little bit
aroused. Unaware of the cloth that had slipped from his hand, he began slowly to
run his fingers on Lán WàngJī’s flawless face.

On the other hand, as he was getting closer to Lán WàngJī, he put his left hand
on the edge of the bathtub to support himself.

As his face gradually approaching his, their breaths intertwined. Then, Wèi
WúXiàn tenderly kissed Lán WàngJī on the forehead.

Suddenly, there was a ripple in the bathwater, caused by Lán WàngJī’s heartbeat.
He then opened his eyes.

Looking into Lán WàngJī’s eyes, Wèi WúXiàn could read a burning desire, which
caused his heart to beat faster.

The steam from the bathwater was spreading around, dampening the thin fabric of
Wèi WúXiàn's robe, which revealed his svelte body.

The more Lán WàngJī stared at Wèi WúXiàn’s body through the wet clothe, the more
horny he became, and his facial expression was announcing the coming storm.

Wèi WúXiàn looked at Lán WàngJī in a coquettish way, parted his red lips and
murmured, “Èr-gēge, you’re really handsome.”

This time, there was a wave that surged in the bathwater; Lán WàngJī’s heart was
racing.

Unable to bear it any longer, he suddenly pulled Wèi WúXiàn into the bathtub,
and held him in his arms.

His breathing had quickened, and, without losing any time, he buried his face on
Wèi WúXiàn’s neck and began to suck it, leaving love bites here and there on the
graceful neck.

“If this is what you want, I’ll give you even more,” thought Wèi WúXiàn.

He then tilted his head back to expose a fair and slim neck, moved his slightly
shaking legs forward, and wrapped them around Lán WàngJī’s waist, and then, he
began to rub his body against his.

It was hard to tell whether he was teasing Lán WàngJī or begging for more.

Lán WàngJī carried on sucking and biting on the slender neck, then kissed and
traced the smooth area of Wèi WúXiàn’s collarbones fervently.

He stroked Wèi WúXiàn’s body inch by inch, making him trembling uncontrollable
under his touch that Wèi WúXiàn pressed his body even more tight against his.

Staring dreamily at the ceiling that was covered with steam, Wèi WúXiàn moaned,
as Lán WàngJī kept on caressing him.

Under bathwater, with Lán WàngJī’s hands fondling him and making him feel so
good, Wèi WúXiàn could not distinguish the right hand from the left one.

It was as though he had turned into a musical instrument in Lán WàngJī’s arms,
and not a single inch was left untouched.

As Lán WàngJī ran his fingers on his back, Wèi WúXiàn sensed the slightly
hardened skin on Lán WàngJī’s fingertips.

He then thought, “This should be his right hand. He uses these fingers to pluck
at the strings of his guqin.”

Wèi WúXiàn then felt Lán WàngJī’s hands gradually moving towards his chest, and
gently rubbing his nipples, and then, his hands slid down and explored his
manhood.

Soon after, Wèi WúXiàn’s breathing quickened, his chest began to move up and
down rapidly. He then lowered his head and looked down.

As he did so, his gaze fell straight into Lán WàngJī’s eyes. He noted that Lán
WàngJī was looking at him with a strong craving.

The urgent hunger for invading and possessing him completely was written all
over Lán WàngJī’s face. And, in the very next moment, Wèi WúXiàn was
overwhelming with intense pleasure.

<br />&nbsp;
... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

Exhausted and fully satisfied, Wèi WúXiàn couldn’t move a muscle, resting 
languorously on Lán WàngJī’s arms.

Lán WàngJī then did everything for him, from thoroughly washing him and wiping
his body to putting clothes on him; the clothes that Wèi WúXiàn had earlier
prepared for both of them to wear after bath.

Then, he carried Wèi WúXiàn to the bed, carefully laid him down, and covered him
with a duvet.

With his head resting on the pillow, Wèi WúXiàn was about to fall asleep
directly, when he caught a glimpse of Lán WàngJī sitting on the bed, beside him,
and looking at him.

Wèi WúXiàn seemed to have something to say to him, so he forced open his eyes
and, in a sleepy voice, he asked, “Lán Zhàn, are you not going to lie on the
bed?”

His sleepy voice sounded so seductive that Lán WàngJī’s ears turned red.

Lán WàngJī, however, didn’t answer but said, “You haven’t eaten yet.” He was
feeling a little bit guilty.

“Just go ahead and eat,” Wèi WúXiàn murmured. He was gradually drowsing.

“I’m not hungry,” replied Lán WàngJī, then he added, “Sleep. I’ll stay here by
your side.”

“Lán Zhàn...” The rest of Wèi WúXiàn’s words were inaudible.

“What did you say?” Lán WàngJī asked, then leaned over so that he could hear
what Wèi WúXiàn was saying.

“Don't be afraid.” Wèi WúXiàn whispered, “I won't leave you. I won’t go
anywhere.”

Lán WàngJī’s eyes suddenly widened in surprise, and, at the same time, he
couldn’t help but clench his fists tight. Then, he looked at Wèi WúXiàn, his
gaze was filled with love and tenderness.

At that moment, Wèi WúXiàn had already fallen asleep.

Lán WàngJī gently kissed him on the forehead, then he smiled. He got into the
bed and lay next to him. He whispered, “Wèi Yīng, I won’t leave you either. I
will always stay by your side.”

<br />&nbsp;
... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

Even though there were not too many cases reported so far in Yúnmèng and Lánlíng territories, however, these regions were densely populated and very prosperous with countless of merchants travelling back and forth.

If the monster’s wine was still circulated, the matter would get worse.

As soon as he landed at Jīnlíntái*, Jīn Líng went straight to his room, sat
down, and then, using his spiritual energy, he began to regulate his breath.

<small>*Jīnlíntái is the name of the LánlíngJīn sect residence.</small>
After he had finished, Jīn Líng poured himself a cup of tea, then took a sip.

At that moment, a disciple came forward to report to him, he said, “Zōng-zhǔ,
Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ is already here waiting for you in the guest room.”

Jīn Líng was astonished. “Didn’t he ask me to meet him in Yúnmèng in two hours?”
he thought, “His lack of patience is really getting worse.”

While pondering that there might be some other important matter that had arisen,
Jīn Líng got up at once and headed to the guest room.

As soon as he entered the room, Jīn Líng saw his uncle with a stern expression
on his face, dressed in robes made of purple brocade, standing by the table.

Jiāng Chéng was tapping his fingers on the table, his almond-shaped eyes seemed
to emit lightning, and, without even being angry, he looked very intimidating.

On the table, there was an open ledger, and in front of him, there were two men
kneeling with their heads close to the floor, and slightly trembling in fear.
These two were accountants of the LánlíngJīn sect.

Without seeing it directly, Jīn Líng knew that the ledger had the emblem of his
sect, and immediately understood the situation in front of him.

He gestured to his underling to close the door, then, he angrily said, “You two,
raise your heads!”

Those words were previously uttered by Jiāng Chéng, but the two accountants
didn’t dare to look up at him. However, when they noticed that it was Jīn Líng,
they hurriedly looked at him and began to beg for mercy, “Zōng-zhǔ, please spare
us. We——”

At that moment, Jiāng Chéng suddenly slapped the table and a purple light
flashed from his ring, then, he snorted coldly. The two of them quickly kept
their mouths shut.

Jīn Líng was angry, as well as displeased, because he felt that he was not
ruthless enough to establish his authority.

And also, since he was still a young and inexperienced leader, it was hard for
him to gain support from other members of his sect.

He knew very well that he could not keep on relying on his uncle, otherwise, he
might not able to become independent.

Jīn Líng composed himself, took a few steps forward, his eyes ran through the
open ledger, then, in a stern tone, he said, “Tell me the truth, how much did
you spend? Where did you get the wine from? And where have you been circulating
that wine?”

He then added, “Don’t think that you’ll get away with it. I will punish you
according to LánlíngJīn’s law. If you dare to cover up——”

Jīn Líng instantly pulled out Suìhuá and slashed the hair buns of the two
accountants.

The sword light swept across the room with great strength, striking the wall and
leaving a deep cut, then, the two men’s hair fell on the floor.

The hair was cut in a neat and skilful way that it caused Jiāng Chéng to frown
in thought, while the two men were so frightened that they collapsed on the
floor.

The two accountants actually didn’t have any ulterior motive, they usually did
their work without any mistakes or omissions. So, Jīn Líng suspected that
someone else must have been acting in the dark.

After being thrown into panic, the two men confessed everything, revealing the
mastermind behind the scene. It was Jīn Chǎn, Jīn Líng’s cousin, who was
plotting all this.

Back then when they were very young, his cousins used to bully him. And, later
on, when Jīn Líng became the leader of their sect, many were unwilling to accept
it, and the most dissatisfied one was Jīn Chǎn.

Luckily for Jīn Líng, Jiāng Chéng often came to visit under the pretence of
seeing his nephew, while constantly probing and keeping an eye on everything.

Wèi WúXiàn also occasionally came over along with the young disciples of
GūsūLán. On the surface, it seemed like a simple visit, however, under the hood,
he checked for any looming shadow.

After the confession of the two accountants, it turned out that the monster,
that had caused trouble for common people, was cultivated by humans.

It was not an easy task to keep a monster under control. So, at some point, it
had escaped and began to harm people.

And also, Jīn Líng was very furious after he learned that the wine that could
confuse people’s mind was specially brought here for Jiāng Chéng and him to
drink.

Then, he thought that since they had learned the truth, if Jīn Chǎn was closely
monitoring his every move, chances were that he was likely to go into hiding by
now.

After telling his uncle his thought, Jiāng Chéng said coldly, “<em>The monk may
run away, but he cannot take the temple with him.</em>* All his assets will be
confiscated. We will settle this account with him eventually.”

<small>*This Chinese idiom means you can run away, however, you will be caught
sooner or later.</small>

But Jīn Líng nodded with a gloomy expression on his face. When they rushed out
to investigate this matter, and finally locate the monster’s lair, then destroy
it, he thought that things had turned out well.

However, he never expected that the source of this matter was within his own
sect, which made him feel very frustrated.

Jiāng Chéng noticed Jīn Líng’s state of mind, however, he wasn’t good at
comforting people. So, thinking of Jīn Líng’s early sword slash, he asked, “Did
you run into Wèi WúXiàn during your Night Hunting?”

The question surprised Jīn Líng, nevertheless, he nodded.

In a displeased way, Jiāng Chéng clicked his tongue, and uttered, “So, he was
the one who destroyed the monster’s lair.”

“No, it was——” Jīn Líng quickly interrupted himself when he suddenly remembered
Lán SīZhuī’s request regarding Lán WàngJī’s condition, then he resumed, “Yes, it
was him who did it.”

Jiāng Chéng obviously noticed Jīn Líng’s hesitation. He frowned and said, “If it
was him who did it, so be it. Why are you hesitating?”

Then, he asked, “Where is he?”

“Ah?!” Jīn Líng was puzzled as well as stunned. It was as though the answer was
not obvious to his uncle. He replied, “He went back to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.”
