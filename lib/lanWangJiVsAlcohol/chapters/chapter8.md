As the years went by, Lán WàngJī’s cultivation was also getting higher. However,
he still went to his mother’s dwelling, waiting outside the door that would
never open again.

Everyone could only sighed, feeling helpless.

Lán Yǎn looked at Lán WàngJī’s back, and it seemed to him that he was looking at
their father’s back, and could not help but feel worried.

His worries would last until Lán WàngJī became an unparalleled cultivator, and a
role model for the disciples of his sect until that day, at Nightless Sky City.

Although Lán Yǎn had been practising medicine for many years, in his whole life,
he had never seen such terrible injuries on Lán WàngJī’s back. Neither had he
ever seen Lán XīChén looking extremely worried.

Lán Yǎn and the rest of the physicians didn’t dare to ask the cause of Lán
WàngJī’s injuries, they only focused on healing him.

Soon after, they learned that Lán WàngJī had received such a heavy punishment,
because he had defended Wèi WúXiàn by fighting against the elders of his own
sect.

During his sleep, Lán WàngJī would keep whispering his name, “Wèi Yīng.”

It was hard to tell whether calling his name was helping him soothe his pain, or
was because he was grieving for Wèi WúXiàn.

Lán Yǎn felt distressed watching Lán WàngJī in such a state.

Lán WàngJī spent three years bedridden with his injuries. After that, he spent
ten years going wherever ordinary people were in trouble in order to assist
them, while, every single day, he would make enquiries about Wèi WúXiàn to the
spirits.

Finally, after thirteen years since his injuries, Lán WàngJī brought Wèi WúXiàn
to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù. Afterwards, they became a married couple.

Lán Yǎn looked at the newlyweds with satisfaction, watching Lán WàngJī, just
like his father, humble yet with an outstanding personality, taking off his
forehead ribbon and wrapping it around Wèi WúXiàn’s wrist. At that moment, Lán
WàngJī’s face, unlike the usual cold expression, was filled with joy of a wish
came true.

Since then, Lán Yǎn was aware of how happy Lán WàngJī was, and how people around
here were praising Wèi WúXiàn.

And, earlier, he also noticed how pleased Lán XīChén was while referring to Wèi
WúXiàn. Lán Yǎn felt that Lán WàngJī’s choice was the best, then went back to
taking care of his patients.

<br />&nbsp;
... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

As he left the medical care building, Lán XīChén began to think about what he had learned regarding the cases occurred in Lánlíng and Yúnmèng territories, He had already dispatched their people to keep an eye on bars and inns of Gūsū territory, just in case.

Then, his thoughts turned to his young brother, wondering if he was sober now.
He then decided to head towards Jingshi to check for himself.

Although he was sure that Wèi WúXiàn would handle everything just fine, Lán
XīChén wanted to be sure that Lán WàngJī was fine.

Also, since Wèi WúXiàn had a close relationship with both, YúnmèngJiāng and
LánlíngJīn sects, he thought that he could discuss the matter with him.

<br />&nbsp;
... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

In Jingshi, Lán WàngJī was sitting at the edge of the bed, gazing pleasingly at Wèi WúXiàn, who was sleeping soundly.

For someone who was usually lively, Wèi WúXiàn looked like a quiet person while
sleeping, which made him look more adorable.

Unlike him to throw in the towel so easily during their lovemaking, and hadn’t
let out his usual load and horny moans, showed how Wèi WúXiàn was exhausted.

Lán WàngJī had noticed it, however, since he was still drunk, he couldn’t
suppress his desire of making love to him. And no matter how many times Wèi
WúXiàn begged him to have mercy on him, Lán WàngJī would pretend not to hear his
pleading until Wèi WúXiàn could no longer bear it.

Lán WàngJī gently pulled the duvet over Wèi WúXiàn, and adjusted the collar of
his robe so to cover some love bites.

Since he had been in coma for hours, and also, right now it was far before the
bedtime set according to GūsūLán rules, Lán WàngJī was not feeling sleepy at
all.

He then looked across the room, there was a significant amount of water splashed
on the floor due to their early activity on the bathtub; that activity had also
caused the wooden bathtub to be slightly deformed, likely enough, it was still
in one piece; and on the screen divider, clothes had been randomly hanged, while
some had been thrown on the floor.

Looking at this mess for a while, and besides not being completely sober, Lán
WàngJī’s cleanliness took over. He stood up and walked over to clean up.

Just he was about to pick up clothes on the floor, Lán WàngJī sensed someone
approaching their door. He slightly frowned, walked calmly to the door and
opened it.

Surprised, Lán XīChén, who was about to knock on the door, slowly lowered his
hand, as the door opened before he could do the knocking.

Lán XīChén looked at his young brother in disbelief—the latter was only wearing
a thin garment, and his facial expression was as calm as ever.

A rictus appeared on the corner of Lán XīChén’s mouth, as he scanned Lán WàngJī
up and down, thinking that this scene was happening in broad daylight.

Lán WàngJī then uttered, “Xiōng-zhǎng!”

Lán XīChén quickly cleared his throat, and began, “Sorry, WàngJī. Can you
please——”

At that precise moment, a whimper of pain was heard, coming from the room,
followed by the rustling sound of someone tossing and turning. Immediately, Lán
WàngJī closed the door, leaving his older brother outside.

Lán XīChén was staggered by Lán WàngJī’s action, he said, “Is WàngJī still
drunk?”

<br />&nbsp;
... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

At the entrance of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, Jiang Cheng landed, then stepped off of his sword.

The two disciples in charge of guarding the gate hurried forward and saluted
him. One of them politely said, “We were not aware that Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ was
coming. Please forgive us for not giving you a proper welcome.”

Jiang Cheng curbed his anger, nodded slightly in response and said, “I’m here to
discuss some important matter with HánGuāng-Jūn. I hope you will inform him
without delay.”

Since they didn’t know that Lán WàngJī had already woken up, the other disciple
replied, “Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ, right now, it is inconvenient for HánGuāng-Jūn to
receive visitors. Please accept our apologies. If the matter is urgent, could
you please discuss it with Zéwú-Jūn?”

Jiang Cheng could not help but clench his fist, he thought, “Lán WàngJī is not
in a position to receive guests. Apparently, something really happened to Wèi
WúXiàn during their Night Hunting.”

He then replied, “All right.”

The two disciples simultaneously said, “Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ, please follow us.”

As Jiang Cheng walked past the gate, they heard someone saying, “Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ,
please wait!”

Jiang Cheng saw Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí rushing towards him. From the looks of
it, they came over to stop him. His facial expression suddenly darkened.

Looking at Jiang Cheng's gloomy face, Lán SīZhuī took a deep breath, not knowing
where to start. Not long ago, he received Jīn Líng’s message saying, “My uncle
is heading to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù to settle accounts with Wèi WúXiàn. If you can,
send him away so to prevent them getting into a fight.”

“I didn’t expect anyone to be aware of my coming here,” Jiang Cheng sneered.

Lán SīZhuī knew that Jiang Cheng had a bad temperament, and, although Wèi WúXiàn
and Wēn Níng no longer had bad reputations, Jiang Cheng hadn’t let go of his
grudge.

He then bit the bullet and said, “Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ, please forgive my boldness.
May I have a word with you?”

Jiang Cheng coldly snorted, “It is well known that GūsūLán sect has strict
rules. Why are their disciples lack of respect?”

Annoyed, Lán JǐngYí retorted, “Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ, why are you saying that SīZhuī is
disrespectful. He politely asked to talk to you about the urgent matter.”

“If you have an urgent matter, why didn’t you tell Jīn Líng to inform me?” Jiang
Cheng counterattacked.

Then, while fiddling with Zǐdiàn* on his ring finger, he sneered, “I don’t think
you have something to say to me—you are actually trying to conceal something.”

<small>*Zǐdiàn is a ring that, when it is used as a weapon, changes into a
whip.</small>

In a stern tone, Jiang Cheng asked, “Where is Wèi WúXiàn?”

Lán SīZhuī nervously said, “Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ, please listen to me.”

Jiang Cheng frowned, grabbed one of the two disciples by the neck. His
fingertips, glowing with purple light, were pressed against that disciple’s
throat. He stormed, “I don’t want to hear any more nonsense. Tell me where Wèi
WúXiàn is?”

Shaking with fear under the pressure of Jiang Cheng’s powerful spiritual energy,
the disciple quickly replied, “He is in Jingshi, which is located on the other
side of the mountain.”

Jiang Cheng abruptly released him, stepped on his sword and flew towards
Jingshi.

The poor thing, who had collapsed on the ground, got up, feeling embarrassed by
his submissiveness, he said to Lán SīZhuī, “Shī-xiōng*, I'm sorry.”

<small>*Shī-xiōng means senior brother (in any learning skills, e.g.: martial
art, medicine, etc.).</small>

Lán SīZhuī hadn’t expected Jiang Cheng to react so aggressively; he actually
threatened a GūsūLán disciple while being at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù!

Anxious, Lán SīZhuī became confused at the same time. Jīn Líng was safe and
sound—nothing happened to him. So, what caused Jiang Cheng to want to clash with
Wèi WúXiàn?

Gritting his teeth, Lán SīZhuī thought, “Sometimes, Wèi-qiánbèi secretly works
hard to solve issues that occur in Yúnmèng and Lánlíng territories.

“He once was a YúnmèngJiāng disciple, so he should be regarded as Jīn Líng’s
uncle, as well.

“Although he now becomes part of GūsūLán sect and HánGuāng-Jūn’s partner,
Wèi-qiánbèi is still doing his best to protest the two of them.”

Lán SīZhuī didn’t have time to cheer his Shī-dì* up, he only said, “Don’t tell
anyone about what happened here.”

<small>*Shī-dì means junior brother, it’s the opposite of Shī-xiōng.</small>
Then, with Lán JǐngYí, they stepped on their swords and followed Jiang Cheng.

<br />&nbsp;
... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

It was pitch dark in here. From a far distance, one could see some lights faintly shone like stars in the night sky.

“What is this place? Why is it so dark and noisy?”

A voice seemed to come from far, however, it was too noisy to distinguish the
spoken words. It looked like many people were yelling continuously, but their
figures appeared like countless shadows packed like a large herd of cattle.

“Why are they shouting?”

Wèi WúXiàn felt his whole arching; he could not see where he was heading; it was
getting harder to continue walking; and he felt like giving up but a strong will
kept his body moving forward.

He tried to grab something for support but there’s nothing around him—a complete
emptiness.

From time to time, the same voice reached him, but there was no one in sight,
and no place to return to.

He could not recall any name to call out. Even if he did, he wasn’t even sure
that someone would reply to him.

“Wèi-gōngzǐ?”

“Who is calling me?” Wèi WúXiàn wondered.

“Gōngzǐ, are you all right?” The same voice came again.

Surprised, Wèi WúXiàn thought, “It’s Wēn Níng!”

“Wèi WúXiàn, why did you buy potatoes again? What about the radishes?” another
voice reached him.

“This is Wen Qing’s voice!” Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed.

He began to run towards where the voices came from, staggering along the way,
and saying, “I am here. Where are you?”

“Xian-gēge, it's so dark here.”

“A-Yuàn?!” Wèi WúXiàn felt his heart sank. “Where is A-Yuàn? Where did I leave
A-Yuàn?”

Suddenly, someone yelled, “Yílíng Lǎozǔ is here!”

Extremely shocked, Wèi WúXiàn turned around just in time to grab the arrow that
was aimed at him. The darkness had dissipated, revealing a crowd of people,
holding torches, encircled him.

“Wèi WúXiàn! You evil heretic! You won’t escape today!”

“Today we will uphold justice in the name of heaven!”

“Let's work together to destroy this demon!”

“Let’s kill him!”

“It's too noisy.” Wèi WúXiàn repeated these words in his head for a while, then,
suddenly, he shouted, “You are too noisy!”

At the same time, he hurled the arrow he had snatched back to his assailant, and
it pierced his neck.

People around looked terrified by the counter-attack. Others hurriedly
encouraged them, “Don’t be afraid! Let’s kill this devil and take the Yin Tiger
Talisman!”

“That’s right! We can’t the Yin Tiger Talisman into his hands!”

Wèi WúXiàn sneered, “Well, well! You are just a bunch of self-righteous,
despicable people under the banner of justice. You all are just coveting the Yin
Tiger Talisman.”

Demons in the mass burial seemed to have sensed Wèi WúXiàn’s killing intent,
began to get moving.

Placing Chénqíng against his lips, Wèi WúXiàn uttered, “Come on! Attack me if
you dare! Today, I will let all of you experience what it feels like to have no
way back.”
