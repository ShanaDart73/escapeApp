Wèi WúXiàn slowly opened his eyes. On the pillow, his long and thick black hair
looked like a waterfall. It was further adorned with his red hairband. His fair
and handsome face was slightly tinted with red colour.

With his black eyes sparkling like a surface of a pond in the moonlight, and his
lips curved into a smile, the lips that had been devoured by the kisses to the
point of turning scarlet and tempting, Wèi WúXiàn looked fully satisfied after
being intensively loved by Lán WàngJī.

Now that his overly sexual desire had been quenched, Lán WàngJī held Wèi WúXiàn
in his arms, tenderly brushed aside some hair that had fallen on Wèi WúXiàn’s
forehead, and adjusted the collar of Wèi WúXiàn’s top garment.

Having his breathing gradually returning to a normal pace, Wèi WúXiàn leaned his
head against Lán WàngJī’s chest, while trying to figure out Lán WàngJī’s
out-of-character reactions.

The two of them remained silent for a while.

Meanwhile, Wèi WúXiàn was recalling what happened from the moment Lán WàngJī
joined him in the cave until now. Then, he came to the conclusion that something
was off with Lán WàngJī.

He then looked at him with a serious expression on his face, and asked, “Lán
Zhàn, who am I?”

Lán WàngJī’s eyes widened in surprise, then, he replied, “I know that you are
Wèi Yīng.”

Wèi WúXiàn shook his head, and said, “This is not what I mean.”

As he spoke, he raised his upper body, held Lán WàngJī’s face, then, he asked
again, “Look around the room carefully, then, tell me, who am I to you?”

Wèi WúXiàn’s question puzzled Lán WàngJī. Nevertheless, he scanned the room that
was very familiar to him, then, soon after, he noticed that both the wardrobe
and the bookshelf were more larger than usual.

Lán WàngJī looked perplexed for a moment, then, he seemed to recall something,
and quickly looked at Wèi WúXiàn, he began, “You and I——”

Wèi WúXiàn gave him an encouraging smile.

Lán WàngJī closed his eyes, and began to search his memory, then, suddenly, he
reopened his eyes, his face at this time wore his usual expression.

He resumed, “After our three kowtows, you and I have been living as a couple.”

“That’s right,” said Wèi WúXiàn with a bright smile on his face.

Lán WàngJī went on, “And, it’s been more that three years that what we feel for
each other is mutual.”

“Indeed,” said Wèi WúXiàn.

Lán WàngJī said, “Uncle has even included us on the family record book as a
couple.”

“That’s true!” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn.

He then hugged Lán WàngJī and added, “In other words, I’ve been yours for a long
time, and it is known by everyone.”

“Yes,” said Lán WàngJī, then, he kissed Wèi WúXiàn on the forehead, and held him
tight in his arms.

At last, Wèi WúXiàn felt relieved and let out a long sigh. He said, “Finally,
you have recovered your memories.”

“Sorry,” Lán WàngJī said, “A lot of memories flashed into my head so suddenly.”
He seemed as though he was still a little bit confused.

He then buried his face in Wèi WúXiàn’s neck, and, in a sad tone, he went on, “I
remember everything, however, I couldn’t recall them straight away.”

Wèi WúXiàn gently patted his shoulder. He found this situation was a little bit
distressing as well as funny.

By observing Lán WàngJī’s gloomy expression, Wèi WúXiàn concluded that his
memories were not the main issue here. “Is he still drunk?” Wèi WúXiàn pondered.

As a caring partner, Wèi WúXiàn couldn’t bear to see his beloved husband feeling
depressed, and blaming himself for being disoriented.

He comforted him by saying, “JǐngYí also fainted when he got inside the cave.
But he couldn’t even tell what happened to him. Also, that monster’s wine had
the effect of evoking people’s bad memories, and made them feel confused.”

Wèi WúXiàn went on, “However, my HánGuāng-Jūn is so amazing. You have quickly
recovered your memories.”

Lán WàngJī remained silent. He never thought of himself as a reckless person who
would fall into a trap so easily, and feeling that he didn’t deserve to be
praised.

Wèi WúXiàn became helpless, because the lack of reaction from Lán WàngJī was
unusual, especially when he was drunk. “Why does it bother him so much?” he
thought.

“Come on, Èr-gēge! Don’t blame yourself so much. Just tell me what did you see
inside the cave. It’s not good to keep suppressing your emotions.” Wèi WúXiàn
cheered him up.

Lán WàngJī then raised his head and looked at Wèi WúXiàn, his lips were not only
pressed together tightly, but also were trembling slightly, his eyes were filled
with regret.

After a while, he began, “Nightless Sky City* ...” After a shot pause, he
resumed, “I left you by yourself ...” Then he didn’t carry on at this point,
because it was clear, for both of them, what memories he had seen.

<small>*Nightless Sky City is where Wèi WúXiàn fought alone against thousands of
cultivators. When he lost control of himself, Lán WàngJī took him away.</small>
Wèi WúXiàn fell silent. He would have said to him not to take it to heart, if
what he saw were some illusory memories, however, they were real memories.

Those dreadful memories were hard to forget. It was heartbreaking even though
you just looked into one of them.

Both of them were doing their best to live a happy life together as much as
possible, so that, one day, they could look at their devastated past with ease.

Wèi WúXiàn had died once, but brought back through a body sacrifice ritual. He
was given a second chance, after so many years since his death, so he should
live his life in fully.

Even though his physical appearance was not his own, he should start a new life,
and forget the painful experience of being besieged by thousands of cultivators,
as well as the unbearable torture of being devoured by countless demons.

Wèi WúXiàn couldn’t help but begin to reminisce each event that occurred just
after he came back to life.

The first things he recognised was the uniforms of the GūsūLán sect. When he saw
those teenagers from GūsūLán, it brought back memories when he was attending
classes at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.

Then, he commented on those inexperienced juniors, thinking that Lán WàngJī was
already powerful when he was their age.

And, when he met Jīn Líng, at that time he didn’t know his identity, and thought
that the boy had a disrespectful attitude towards people.

Soon after, he saw Wēn Níng who became like a zombie, and Jiāng Chéng who still
bore a grudge towards him after so many years.

Then, when Lán WàngJī grabbed his hand, he sighed inward. He knew at once that
he could no longer escape, even though his intention was to live an ordinary and
peaceful life, in some place where no one knew him.

From then, they started Night Hunting together for several months, and slowly
unravelling the secrets of the past events.

Wèi WúXiàn then carried on recalling the events that happened prior his death.
Thinking that, although he had cut off his Golden Core, he was still unable to
assist Jiāng Chéng to strengthen YúnmèngJiāng sect.

He had promised his Shījiě* that he would give her a grand wedding, but he
couldn’t fulfil his promise. And, in the end, she died along with Jīn ZiXuān,
her husband.

<small>*Shījiě means senior sister. Wèi WúXiàn refers to Jiāng YànLí, Jīn Líng’s
mother.</small>

He was the one who chose the name for his Shījiě’s child, however, he was no
longer there to protect Jīn Líng when was a kid.

He had saved Wēn Qíng and her relatives, but he still failed to keep them safe.

He had tried hard to convince Lán WàngJī to visit Yúnmèng, but he never
succeeded. Back then, he didn’t realise his own feeling towards Lán WàngJī.

After learning how deep he was loved by him, Wèi WúXiàn could barely imagine how
Lán WàngJī was filled with grief at his death, and kept on grieving all those
years.

“And now, he said with regret that he shouldn’t have let me by myself at that
time.” thought Wèi WúXiàn.

“Back then, when I was thrown into the mass grave, what kind of state of mind
had you been in?” Wèi WúXiàn went on.

“About what happened at Nightless Sky City, can you please not recall them at
all?" he kept on thinking.

“How painful was it, when you had received thirty three whips of punishment
because of me?

“Those days when you were alone and continuously asking spirits my whereabouts,
how tormenting was it for you?

“There were so many questions that I wanted to ask, however, they were all as
sharp as a knife that I didn’t dare to ask for fear that they would open the old
wounds.”

Wèi WúXiàn choked back the tears. He then lowered his head, his hair slid and
hid his face. He didn’t want Lán WàngJī to see him looking sad.

After a while, he raised his head and smiled as usual. Then, while undressing
Lán WàngJī, he said, “Since you remember everything, let’s take a bath, then
rest.”

<br />&nbsp;
... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

At the mountain gate of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí saw off Jīn Líng.

Although they got some news from Jiāng Chéng, they were still not sure whether
their guess was exact. So, they decided to wait for those people they had
rescued from that monster’s lair to recover.

Meanwhile, since those incidents had started in Lánlíng territory, Jiāng Chéng
must have found out something, so, he asked Jīn Líng to go back.

Even though Jīn Líng was a little bit reluctant to leave, he knew that he had to
go, since the matter was serious.

Lán JǐngYí noticed the dark circles under Jīn Líng’s eyes, and felt a little bit
guilty, recalling that when he was having a nightmare, to help him, Lán SīZhuī
played his guqin, which actually disturbed Jīn Líng from getting some rest.

He said, “Is it really urgent that you have to leave now? You look so exhausted.
What don’t you stay and rest for a while?”

Jīn Líng rolled his eyes and uttered, “There’s no need. Besides, with my uncle’s
temperament, do you think he has patience to wait? I think that you two should
deal with the issues you have right now.”

Since they were still unaware that Lán WàngJī had already woken, Jīn Líng was
referring to him, as well as those innocent people who were affected by the
monster’s wine. Then, the three of them suddenly looked gloomy.

They agreed that if there was any new occurrence on the matter, they would
communicate to each other via Wèi WúXiàn’s transmitter talismans.

Suddenly, Lán SīZhuī said, “Jīn zōng-zhǔ, please don’t let anyone know about
HánGuāng-Jūn’s condition, since we don’t know exactly what happened to him.”

That was because Lán WàngJī had a high status not only in GūsūLán sect, but also
in the entire world of cultivation. It was better to be cautious, and avoid any
unnecessary commotion.

As a young leader who had gained insight into the cultivation world, Jīn Líng
understood the meaning behind what Lán SīZhuī said, and nodded his head to show
his cooperation.

He then quietly recited his sword incantation, and Suìhuá emitted a golden
light, unsheathed itself and suspended flat above the ground level.

Putting his qiánkūn-dài* on his shoulder, Jīn Líng stepped on his sword, and
flew across the sky like a feathered arrow that emitted a golden light.

<small>*qiánkūn-dài is a dimensionless bag that can contain anything.</small>
After watching Jīn Líng flying away until he disappeared from their sight, Lán
SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí turned around, and began to climb the stairs to return to
their dwelling.

As they did so, Lán SīZhuī fell into silence, and Lán JǐngYí knew that, despite
his calm appearance, Lán SīZhuī was actually very concerned about Lán WàngJī’s
condition.

So, in order to liven up his mood, Lán JǐngYí said, “Look how Dà-XiǎoJiě* was so
eager to go back. I think that Jiāng zōng-zhǔ has uncovered something about this
matter.”

<small>*Dà-XiǎoJiě, in this particular case, means a girl with a bit of a bad
temperament. Lán JǐngYí usually calls Jīn Líng like this.</small>
He went on, “And, since some common people over there have recovered, I also
believe that HánGuāng-Jūn will wake up soon. So, don’t worry, SīZhuī.”

Upon listening to what Lán JǐngYí said to him, Lán SīZhuī smiled.

Although Lán JǐngYí was carefree and straightforward, Lán SīZhuī knew that,
sometimes, he could make an observation and be thoughtful. After all, they grew
up together, so he knew Lán JǐngYí’s character.

He understood that Lán JǐngYí was trying to comfort him, and, in a gentle voice,
he said, “I know. Thank you, JǐngYí. Besides, this time, Wèi-qiánbèi is here,
so, HánGuāng-Jūn will be fine.”

“That’s right!” exclaimed Lán JǐngYí, “I think that Wèi-qiánbèi is quite cool.
And, in case the situation gets worse, Zéwú-Jūn is also here, as well as other
elders.”

Despite being able to read Lán SīZhuī’s mind, Lán JǐngYí, however, failed to
grasp the real issue that could greatly affect Lán WàngJī.

In spite of his feeling hopeless, Lán SīZhuī just nodded to him. Nevertheless,
he felt more at ease now.

Noting that Lán SīZhuī’s mood had been improved, Lán JǐngYí was satisfied, and
didn’t say anything more. And, after assuring that no one was around to see him,
he lazily stretched his body.

He then began to think about their early conversation, and couldn’t help but
ponder inwardly, “What can possibly frighten HánGuāng-Jūn?”

He went on. “Since the resentful energy that entered my body was expelled after
I was frightened in my dream, what exactly does Wèi-qiánbèi need to do, in order
to force the resentful energy out of HánGuāng-Jūn’s body?”

<br />&nbsp;
... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

After being undressed by Wèi WúXiàn, Lán WàngJī’s wore a blank expression for a short while.

Earlier, when Wèi WúXiàn was silent, even though he couldn’t see his face, Lán
WàngJī felt that his mood was down.

And, when Wèi WúXiàn raised his head and smiled at him, he noted faint
melancholy in Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes.

Although he was overwhelmed by the strong smell of alcohol, which clouded his
thinking, Lán WàngJī was able to regain the memories of their daily routine, and
those memories were right now floating in his head like a dream.

He let Wèi WúXiàn take him to the bathtub, his eyes followed Wèi WúXiàn’s every
movement, watching him walking to the wardrobe and taking out their clothes to
be worn after bath.

He watched Wèi WúXiàn pulling open the panel screen painted with a landscape of
mountains and rivers.

As Wèi WúXiàn moved about, Lán WàngJī’s gaze also followed the graceful movement
of his red hairband.

“My mind is finally in peace,” Lán WàngJī thought, “I can now relax my whole
body, because this is not a dream, the person in front me has indeed become my
partner.”

He went on, “He is no longer a spirit that I couldn’t contact, nor is he a
yearning that I couldn’t obtain.”
