			<p><b>Translator Note:</b></p>
			<p>This is another side story of Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn that has picked my interest.</p>
			<p>The original title, ‘Drunk HánGuāng-Jūn (醉叽含光君)’, for an English reader’s perspective, sounds like: 'He got drunk because he had drunk too much alcohol', which is not what the story is about.</p>
			<p>So, for not to confuse my readers, I've named this story: ‘Lán WàngJī versus Alcohol’.</p>
		</section>
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<p>It was the season for celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival*, the Osmanthus shrubs were in full bloom, and their golden flowers released their sweet fragrance.</p>
		<small>*Mid-Autumn Festival is a harvest festival celebrated in Chinese culture.</small>
		<p>Surrounded by the mountains on one side and a river on the other side, Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù* was located in an excellent neighbourhood.</p>
		<small>*Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù is the name of GūsūLán residence.</small>
		<p>The residence had luxuriant bamboos here and there, including in the courtyards of the dwellings. Some curative springs and streams were also found in Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.</p>
		<p>Since GūsūLán sect had strong moral principles, it had always produced talented cultivators, who drove away evil spirits and purified impure energy around Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù and its surroundings, so that, all year round, the all residence was wrapped with spiritual power.</p>
		<p>However, the three teenagers standing outside Jingshi* were too anxious to admire the scenery of this fairyland.</p>
		<small>*Jingshi, literally means quiet room, is Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn’s dwelling.</small>
		<p>They had returned from their Night Hunting, and were looking very messy with their clothes all covered with dust. However, their scruffy appearance was nothing compared to the anxiety that consumed them.</p>
		<p>Unable to stay still, Lán JǐngYí was pacing up and down, and, from time to time, he would crouch down and put his hands on the back of his head.</p>
		<p>Irritated, Jīn Líng said, “Lán JǐngYí, have you not done enough, already? My head is spinning just by watching you.”</p>
		<p>Looking at Jīn Líng, Lán JǐngYí loudly replied, “No, I haven’t!”</p>
		<p>Then, suddenly, it crossed his mind that he was at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù*, and, furthermore, he was standing outside Jingshi, so he quickly shut his mouth.</p>
		<small>*The rules of GūsūLán forbid to shout or to speak loudly.</small>
		<p>After a short pause, Lán JǐngYí said, “Can’t you see that I am worried. It has been almost four hours, and HánGuāng-Jūn hasn’t woken up yet, and Wèi-qiánbèi*...”</p>
		<small>*qiánbèi is a respectful title to someone older than you.</small>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī could not help but frown when he thought about the incident. However, in comparison with the two other teenagers, he had kept a cool head.</p>
		<p>He took a deep breath, and said, “It happened so suddenly, and, the fact that the demon didn’t have a high level of cultivation makes the matter more difficult to understand.</p>
		<p>“Besides, Wèi-qiánbèi said that there wasn’t any other evil spirits or formation at all. So, why HánGuāng-Jūn...”</p>
		<p>Noticing that Lán JǐngYí and Jīn Líng were looking at him, hanging on his lips, Lán SīZhuī resumed with a reassuring tone, “I think that HánGuāng-Jūn will be fine.”</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí remarked, “But it was HánGuāng-Jūn who received the blow, and he didn’t even notice it. What if the demon was actually very powerful.”</p>
		<p>With annoyance in his tone, Jīn Líng said, “Lán SīZhuī said that he will be fine, then everything will be all right. Since you have time to worry, why not think about what we have overlooked, instead.”</p>
		<p>“It’s easy for you to say. Why don’t you think about it yourself.” protested Lán JǐngYí.</p>
		<p>“You were the first to get inside the lair, and even stayed in there for a long time. If you don’t want to figure it out, who else will?” retorted Jīn Líng.</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí hit back, “I didn’t stayed that long. Besides, I fainted. Now that you mention it, didn’t you also get in there yourself, later on?”</p>
		<p>“You have the nerve to say that you fainted!” exclaimed Jīn Líng.</p>
		<p>“You didn’t faint, but you hadn’t noticed anything either.”  Lán JǐngYí counter-attacked.</p>
		<p>“Lán JǐngYí, if you are asking for a fight, just say so.” uttered Jīn Líng.</p>
		<p>As these two were about to start fighting, Lán SīZhuī, alarmed, said, “Hold on, both of you! You are not allowed to fight here, at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù!”</p>
		<p>“I want to fight, too. Which one of you wants to fight with me?”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn was standing on the threshold of Jingshi, looking at them, with his lips curved into a smile, while his eye were not smiling at all.</p>
		<p>He was wearing black clothes, which enhanced his svelte body, looking quite handsome with the sunlight showering on him.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn wanted to appear as gentle as possible, however, the suffocating pressure that emanated from him was almost palpable.</p>
		<p>He carried on, “Right now, I am very annoyed, however, for your sake, I promise not to beat you to death.”</p>
		<p>Out of fear, the three teenagers instantly kept quiet, looking like they could barely bear the pressure that was upon them.</p>
		<p>At that instance, a gentle voice came from the room, “WúXiàn, WàngJī will be fine. Don’t scare them.” It was Lán XīChén.</p>
		<p>His voice and words made Lán SīZhuī feel at ease. He wanted to ask something to Wèi WúXiàn, however, before he could talk, Wèi WúXiàn, said, “SīZhuī, you guys should go and get some rest.” then, he closed the door as soon as he finished talking.</p>
		<p>The three teenagers looked at each other and thought that it would be wiser to do what they had been told, and leave the rest to Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>As they left, Lán SīZhuī got someone to prepare a room for Jīn Líng.</p>
		<p>After closing the door, Wèi WúXiàn hurried to the bed, sat down on the edge of the bed, took Lán WàngJī’s arm, and, once more, he began attentively to probe his pulse in the wrist.</p>
		<p>After a short while, however, he still could not find any sign of abnormality. He heavily sighed, and put Lán WàngJī’s arm back under the duvet.</p>
		<p>Lying comatose in bed, Lán WàngJī’s facial expression was calm, and his breathing steady. There was no sign of any curse on him, or any external injury. But why was he still unconscious?</p>
		<p>The more Wèi WúXiàn thought about the incident the more puzzled he became. Without wandering his eyes away Lán WàngJī, he asked, “Dà-gē*, you didn’t notice anything either?”</p>
		<small>*Dà-gē means elder brother. However, bear in mind that it can have different meanings. For example, a gang leader can also be called Dà-gē, meaning boss.</small>
		<p>Lán XīChén calmly replied, “There is neither a presence of evil energy nor an external injury. Moreover, though his pulse is slightly faster, his spiritual power is as strong as ever, and he has not been poisoned either. It’s more like...”</p>
		<p>“It’s more like what?” Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly asked, looking at Lán XīChén.</p>
		<p>“I’m not quite sure.” replied Lán XīChén, “WúXiàn, don’t you think that something is off in this room?”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn looked at Lán XīChén with a perplexed expression in his face, “Something is off?”</p>
		<p>Since Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn become a couple, Jingshi had been modified to suit the needs and interests of Wèi WúXiàn, such as extending the wardrobe, as well as the bookshelf for his collection of books and other knick-knacks.</p>
		<p>There was also the hidden compartment under the floor where they put Emperor Smile*. Apart from these modifications, there was nothing unusual in the room.</p>
		<small>*Emperor Smile is Wèi WúXiàn’s favourite wine.</small>
		<p>However, after Lán XīChén’s remark, Wèi WúXiàn began to detect something. He sniffed the air of the room, and noticed that the sandalwood fragrance that filled the room all year round was now mixed with a hint of... alcohol?!</p>
		<p>Moreover, it was not the smell of Emperor Smile, and, on top of that, that smell of alcohol was emanating from Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>“Dà-gē, do you think that Lán Zhàn is... drunk?!” Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed rather than asking.</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén replied, “I have seen WàngJī being drunk before, and the rhythm of his pulse now is similar to when he is drunk.”</p>
		<p>He carried on, “WúXiàn, is it true that the monster you had encountered this time was very good at brewing wine?”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn muttered, “Indeed, the wine brewed by that monster had a very strong smell. JǐngYí was heavily intoxicated as soon as he entered the lair. However, even if Lán Zhàn...”</p>
		<p>He resumed after a short pause, “It is inconceivable that Lán Zhàn would faint just by smelling the wine.”</p>
		<p>Besides, no matter what kind of wine he had drunk before, he would wake up soon after falling asleep. Could it be that the monster’s wine was out of the ordinary?</p>
		<p>“Since it is a fact now that Lán Zhàn is drunk,” thought Wèi WúXiàn, “that will be difficult to handle it here, at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.</p>
		<p>“And, when Lán Zhàn is going to wake up and still drunk, the matter will get even worst. If I had known that fact, I wouldn’t have brought him directly here.”</p>
		<p>Noticing that Wèi WúXiàn’s facial expression had changed, Lán XīChén became a little bit concerned about Wèi WúXiàn’s emotional state.</p>
		<p>He knew that although Wèi WúXiàn was often carefree and unruly, he was also quick-witted and knowledgeable, as well as very good at Night Hunting.</p>
		<p>It was rare for Lán XīChén to see him so anxious. And he easily guessed what caused Wèi WúXiàn to look so upset.</p>
		<p>“Uncle has been informed on the matter, just after you guys came back.” said Lán XīChén, “WúXiàn, why don’t you come with me to consult him. He might shed light on this matter.”</p>
		<p>“That’s right!” thought Wèi WúXiàn, “Lán Lǎo* is highly respected and extremely knowledgeable. It’s a good idea to have his thought on this matter.”</p>
		<small>*Lán Qǐrén, also known as Lán Lǎo, is the uncle of Lán XīChén and Lán WàngJī.</small>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn then readily agreed, stood up, adjusted his clothes, tidied his hair, and there they were on their way to Lán Qǐrén’s dwelling.</p>
		<p>Upon their arrival, a disciple went to inform Lán Qǐrén, while they were waiting outside of the house.</p>
		<p>While thinking on how he should phrase the situation, Wèi WúXiàn adjusted his already-tidy collar once more, “I should not tell Lán Lǎo that Lán Zhàn is drunk right away. Recently, he seems to tolerate my living here. So, it’s better not to upset him.”</p>
		<p>As he carried on thinking, the disciple came out and said, “Zéwú-Jūn and Wèi-qiánbèi, Lán Lǎo is in the sitting room. Please come in, I will lead the way.”</p>
		<p>The two of them followed the disciple, and walked past the hall, then went all the way down the corridor, before reaching the sitting room.</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén was sitting at the centre of the room with his torso in an upright posture, watching them as they entered the room.</p>
		<p>“Sit down.” he said, and, straight to the point, he asked, “What is wrong with WàngJī?”</p>
		<p>“There is nothing wrong with him. It’s just that something is strange.” replied Lán XīChén.</p>
		<p>“What is strange?” asked Lán Qǐrén.</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén then narrated the sequence of events that happened, while Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn and youngsters were out doing their Night Hunting, as well as his examination of Lán WàngJī’s pulse.</p>
		<p>The more Wèi WúXiàn thought about it, the more he became convinced that Lán WàngJī was excessively intoxicated by the smell of the alcohol for him to lose consciousness.</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén also came to the same conclusion that Lán WàngJī was overly drunk. However, he didn’t say anything about it, because he feared that his uncle would get angry and blame it on Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén then called, “Wèi Yīng.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly straightened up his back, and, with a solemn expression on his face, he said, “Uncle, I am all ears.”</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén said, “Since you were also there with WàngJī, don’t you have anything else to say?”</p>
		<p>“As Dà-gē just said, that monster was good at brewing wine.” replied Wèi WúXiàn, “Moreover, its wine has been infiltrated and sold at the market.</p>
		<p>“Whoever drinks that wine will begin to hallucinate, and be unable to control their actions. And also, they will lose their memories after being manipulated by that monster.</p>
		<p>“Once we found out the hideout of that monster,  Lán Zhàn and I went immediately there, and besieged its lair.</p>
		<p>“Although the level of its cultivation was not high, however, the wine it brewed was very strong. It must have be aged for hundreds of years, and also, evil energy had been incorporated into the wine.</p>
		<p>“Since there was an overwhelming smell of alcohol inside the lair, it is likely that Lán Zhàn has been... affected by the smell.”</p>
		<p>Noting a displeased expression on Lán Qǐrén’s face, Wèi WúXiàn said inwardly, “I can’t just say: ‘Your nephew is very drunk. And the reason why he hasn’t woken up yet is because he can’t hold his liquor’.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn then thought again, “The smell of that wine was indeed very unusual. It seems to me that I can still smell it even right now.”</p>
		<p>As he was about to resume his account, Wèi WúXiàn saw Lán Qǐrén looking behind him, with his eyes wide open in surprise. Then, astonished, Lán XīChén exclaimed, “WàngJī?!”</p>
		<p>Before Wèi WúXiàn could turn around, Lán WàngJī had already sat down behind him, wrapped his arms tight around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist and leaned against his back.</p>
		<p>The fragrance of sandalwood that usually accompanied his embrace was now replaced by the smell of the monster’s wine.</p>
		<p>Inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn said, “No wonder why I just thought that I could smell that alcohol.”</p>
		<p>With Lán WàngJī embracing him in front of his uncle, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t dare to cast a glance in Lán Qǐrén’s direction. Instead, he hurriedly tried to set himself free from Lán WàngJī’s cuddle.</p>
		<p>He began, “Lán Zhàn...”</p>
		<p>Before Wèi WúXiàn could finish his sentence, Lán WàngJī tenderly kissed his forehead then his temple, as he always did when he woke up in the morning.</p>
		<p>Then, he buried his head behind Wèi WúXiàn’s neck, moving his lips up and down along Wèi WúXiàn’s nape in an arousing caress, while he kept on whispering his name, “Wèi Yīng.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn became dazed by Lán WàngJī’s kisses. He could feel the warm breath of Lán WàngJī mixed with the aroma of alcohol on the soft skin of his neck, which made him feel like his face was burning hot.</p>
		<p>When they were only the two of them, Wèi WúXiàn would readily respond to Lán WàngJī’s invitation. However, right here and right now was out of the question. Furthermore, Lán Qǐrén was about to faint.</p>
		<p>“What should I do now?” in panic, Wèi WúXiàn began thinking, “Is it too late to tell uncle that Lán Zhàn is drunk?</p>
		<p>“If I have known that thing would turn out like this, I wouldn’t have kept quiet about him being drunk.</p>
		<p>“And then again, how could I possibly guess that we would end up in this awkward situation.</p>
		<p>“As we speak, I can feel Lán Zhàn tightening more and more his embrace around my waist. And, since he is really drunk, I’m afraid that what comes next will be even more unacceptable.”</p>
		<p>“WàngJī, your behaviour is inappropriate. Let go of him, already!” thundered Lán Qǐrén.</p>
		<p>Usually, it was this unruly Wèi WúXiàn who would openly flirt with his nephew, since he had such a personality.</p>
		<p>However, ever since Wèi WúXiàn became Lán WàngJī’s partner, he had shown manners in front of him and the rest of the elders. And also, he often assisted and guided the young disciples during Night Hunting.</p>
		<p>So, in some occasions, when Wèi WúXiàn misbehaved, Lán Qǐrén would turn a blind eye. In contrast, his nephew had always an irreproachable conduct. So, why was he acting like this now?</p>
		<p>Seeing that his uncle got upset, and that Wèi WúXiàn’s attempt to free himself from Lán WàngJī’s arms failed, Lán XīChén hurriedly explained the situation, “Uncle, don’t get angry at him. WàngJī has been affected by the monster’s evil energy. That’s why he is behaving strangely.”</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén frowned, then uttered, “He has been affected by evil energy?”</p>
		<p>After a careful examination, Lán Qǐrén didn’t find any trace of evil energy in Lán WàngJī, instead, he detected the smell of alcohol emanating from Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>His nephew was very strict, he would not drink alcohol, especially when he was out doing Night Hunting, unless...</p>
		<p>Noting that Lán Qǐrén looked at him in a sceptical way, Wèi WúXiàn quickly said, “Uncle, Lán Zhàn didn’t drink any alcohol at all. That monster was relying on its wine to confuse people. I think the smell of its wine has the same effect. JǐngYí also passed out soon after entering the lair.”</p>
		<p>In order to teach the youngsters, Wèi WúXiàn had set a formation around the lair to block the monster’s actions, and placed a protection talisman on each of them to avoid a surprise attack.</p>
		<p>He had organised his training so that, in turn, each teenager would lead the way. And this Night Hunting was Lán JǐngYí’s turn to take the lead.</p>

		<br />
		<p>When the teenagers went Night Hunting with Wèi WúXiàn, they usually joked around to make them feel less nervous. This time, however, Lán WàngJī was there as well, so the atmosphere was intense.</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí was a little bit anxious, thinking that if he didn’t perform well he would definitely be punished later on. After unsheathing his sword, he entered the monster’s lair.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn had reminded him before getting inside the lair that if he noticed any anomaly, he should at once send the signal.</p>
		<p>Although the monster’s level of cultivation was not high, they must not drop their guard, because this was the first time they encountered a monster that used wine to lure people.</p>
		<p>Some time had elapsed since Lán JǐngYí went in, and no sound of fighting had been heard either.</p>
		<p>So, Lán WàngJī used his spiritual energy to probe the lair, then, frowning slightly, he said, “I didn’t detect the sound his footsteps.”</p>
		<p>“No sound of JǐngYí’s footsteps?” thought Wèi WúXiàn, “Something must have stopped him from moving forward.”</p>
		<p>Seeing that Lán WàngJī was about to enter the lair, Wèi WúXiàn stopped him by saying, “Lán Zhàn, the inside of the monster’s lair must be very dusty. It would be a shame if your white clothes get dirty. Leave it to me.” Then, he bent and entered the lair.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng decided to follow suit after thinking that he was there to learn and practise, so he couldn’t just stay there watching and do nothing.</p>
		<p>As soon as he penetrated into the lair, Wèi WúXiàn was welcomed with very strong aroma of wine.</p>
		<p>The smell was so extreme that it made even a wine lover like Wèi WúXiàn feel suffocated. As for Jīn Líng, he could not suppress a series of cough.</p>
		<p>Instinctively, Wèi WúXiàn felt that he had been targeted. He at once threw three talismans in front of him, and said, “Jīn Líng, find JǐngYí and carry him outside.”</p>
		<p>An angry roar came from where the talismans struck, then the red light produced by the talismans revealed where the monster was.</p>
		<p>A smirk appeared on Wèi WúXiàn’s face while looking at the monster, he resumed, “Don’t let Lán Zhàn or Lán SīZhuī get here, because they are not good at drinking. If they breathe this strong smell of alcohol, they will definitely faint.”</p>
		<p>Then, at leisure, he moved forward to confront the monster.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng began to cast about and find Lán JǐngYí close by, lying on the ground. He noticed that Lán JǐngYí had fainted, and could not help but roll his eyes.</p>
		<p>He then made Lán JǐngYí stand up by supporting him, so he could drag him out of the lair. As he began to move, Jīn Líng felt that something was preventing him from dragging Lán JǐngYí.</p>
		<p>He suddenly realised that Lán JǐngYí’s ankle was grabbed by something. Alarmed, Jīn Líng hit that thing with his palm. His attack made that thing to move backwards.</p>
		<p>He then drew Suìhuá* and swung it horizontally while still supporting Lán JǐngYí. His sword produced a bright light that illuminated his surroundings.</p>
		<small>*Suìhuá is the name of Jīn Líng’s sword.</small>
		<p>Seeing who was his opponents, Jīn Líng’s eyes widened in surprise; unexpectedly, there were common people inside the lair of the monster!</p>
		<p>He also noticed that they didn’t act of their own free will, they seemed to be manipulated to attack him. And, since they were common people, Jīn Líng knew that he could not use Suìhuá against them.</p>
		<p>So, he calmed himself down, sheathed his sword, and started to kick away those who were getting close to attack him.</p>
		<p>To his surprise, Jīn Líng noted that they seemed not to feel pain at all, and kept coming towards him.</p>
		<p>To avoid hurting those people, Jīn Líng was not using his full strength. However, after a while, he felt that the situation was hopeless.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn also had to deal with many puppets, while the monster was hiding itself behind them.</p>
		<p>However, the talismans on the monster’s body helped Wèi WúXiàn to locate it. It was just a matter of time before it got caught.</p>
		<p>A red light flashed from Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes, as he narrowed them. And, all of a sudden, the inside of the lair became eerie; Wèi WúXiàn had summoned dark energy along with demons. And, like a rope, that energy tied up all those puppets.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng let out a sigh of relief, then, he asked, “Why are there so many common people in here, as well as the souls of dead people?”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn laughed, then replied, “That’s because there are so many drunkards.”</p>
		<p>While joking, Wèi WúXiàn was actually using Chénqíng* to also control countless of dead people’s souls, so that he could stop them from roaming inside the lair, and, peacefully, dispatch them from this world.</p>
		<small>*Chénqíng is the name of Wèi WúXiàn’s flute.</small>
		<p>After a quick observation, Wèi WúXiàn came to the conclusion that the presence of those souls indicated that many people had be killed here by the monster, while those who were still alive must had been brought here recently.</p>
		<p>Also, the smell of the corpses had been overpowered by the strong smell of the wine. No wonder Wèi WúXiàn didn’t detect any smell of those who were slaughtered by the monster.</p>
		<p>“Tut.” Wèi WúXiàn said inwardly, “This is the first time I find that the smell of alcohol can also be disgusting.”</p>
		<p>Then, skilfully spinning Chénqíng between his fingers, which, in turn, gracefully swayed the red tassel attached at one end of the flute, Wèi WúXiàn got close to the monster that was now held down by the dark energy.</p>
		<p>He said, “It’s rare to see a monster that can brew wine. I would love to capture you alive, and study your abilities. But...”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn paused, and then waved Chénqíng. As a result, the dark energy strangled the monster until the sound of the broken bones could be heard.</p>
		<p>In a cold tone, he resumed, “it’s pity that you have done too much of evil deeds.”</p>
		<p>As soon as he finished speaking, the demons, which were summoned and waiting for that moment, rushed to devour the monster. And, the very next instant, there was nothing left of it.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn then joined Jīn Líng, and, with a smile on his face, he asked, “Are you scared?”</p>
		<p>“I... I’m not scared.”  Jīn Líng quickly replied.</p>
		<p>“If you are not scared, why are you still standing here, then?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng replied, “That’s because Lán JǐngYí is too heavy.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn shook his head helplessly, and said, “If you can’t even handle his weight, then, you will need to practise harder.” Wèi WúXiàn remarked.</p>
		<p>Then, he turned around and glanced at those people who were now looking like the zombies. He suddenly felt gloomy just by observing their states.</p>
		<p>“I can’t use Chénqíng to control the living being.” he thought, “If I do, in order to guide them out of the lair, I’m afraid that it would damage their brains.”</p>
		<p>He carried on thinking, “If I want to bring them to their senses, I will need Lán Zhàn to play his Melody of Lucidity.”</p>
		<p>After pondering for a short while, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Jīn Líng, ask Lán Zhàn to expand the entrance in order to let the fresh air in, and the smell of the wine out. Meanwhile, I will explore the cave.”</p>
		<p>Soon after Jīn Líng left the lair dragging the unconscious Lán JǐngYí, Wèi WúXiàn heard a continuous sound of a sword hitting the entrance of the cave.</p>
		<p>He cautiously lit a touch. He didn’t do it before because he was afraid that it might cause an explosion due to the smell of the alcohol in the air.</p>
		<p>As he surveyed the inside of the lair, Wèi WúXiàn found hundreds of jars containing wine. “No wonder there is a lasting smell of alcohol inside the cave.” he said.</p>
		<p>He carried on, “In order to find out what is wrong with this wine, I should take a few jars to study the wine later on, when we get back home.”</p>
		<p>As he was about to pick up a jar, Wèi WúXiàn felt like something brushed his fingers, and he quickly reacted by moving a few steps backwards.</p>
		<p>Then, in front of him, he saw a little creature jumped out from a jar, and rushed towards him. At the same time, other little creatures, one by one, were coming out of their respective jars.</p>
		<p>As they did so, the jars lost balance, knocking the adjacent ones, and, one after another, they crashed on the ground, with a continuous loud smash.</p>
		<p>Some of the jars that contained wine fell on the ground as well, which released more smell of alcohol inside the lair.</p>
		<p>“This cave is actually a den of monsters!” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn , “That monster had in fact gave birth to such a larger group of offspring!”</p>
		<p>There was no time to ponder. After extinguishing the touch, Wèi WúXiàn quickly played some notes on his flute with the intention of catching them all at once.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, after listening to Jīn Líng’s account, checking Lán JǐngYí’s condition, and asking Lán SīZhuī to play Melody of Lucidity to wake him up, Lán WàngJī widened the entrance of the lair, and was now waiting for the smell of wine to dissipate, when, all of a sudden, he heard the piercing sound of Chénqíng.</p>
		<p>Before Jīn Líng could stop him, Lán WàngJī, alarmed, rushed into the cave.</p>
		<p>Since the smell of the alcohol inside the lair had become more stronger than before, due to the wine that splashed onto the floor, Lán WàngJī felt a sudden splitting headache just by inhaling the smell.</p>
		<p>He shook his head, trying to suppress the pain, then quickly moved further down the cave.</p>
		<p>In the darkness, Lán WàngJī discerned countless of pairs of green eyes, which surrounded the slender figure blowing into the flute.</p>
		<p>Seized with terror, Lán WàngJī summoned WàngJī*, and quickly strummed his fingers on the guqin, which caused the seven strings to vibrate violently.</p>
		<small>*WàngJī is the name of Lán WàngJī’s guqin.</small>
		<p>Like a weapon, the sound emitted by WàngJī caused those little monsters to howl in pain.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn was not only startled but also noticed that something was not quite right with the notes that Lán WàngJī produced.</p>
		<p>As he turned around, he saw Lán WàngJī, who was almost running towards him, then, he held him tight in his arms.</p>
		<p>While hugging Wèi WúXiàn, Lán WàngJī, in silence, was gritting his teeth, with a frown between his eyebrows.</p>
		<p>Noting that something was wrong with Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn became worried, and tried to free himself from his hug in order to examine him carefully, but failed.</p>
		<p>Then, all of a sudden, Lán WàngJī raised his head, and slowly looked around, then fixed his gaze at Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn recognised the look on Lán WàngJī’s face. It was the same look that Lán WàngJī had, from time to time, when he woke up from a nightmare.</p>
		<p>When it happened, Lán WàngJī would desperately hold him tight, and then, he would gaze at him in daze, with that look on his face.</p>
		<p>“Lán Zhàn?” in a low voice, Wèi WúXiàn called. </p>
		<p>With his lips slightly trembling, Lán WàngJī was still looking at him in stupor.</p>
		<p>Then, suddenly, he turned around, shielded Wèi WúXiàn with his body, summoned WàngJī once again, and, this time, he produced some blue spiritual strings that pierced through the darkness.</p>
		<p>The blue strings hit the wall of the cave, and blew up some segment of the wall.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly stopped him from striking again, because, if he carried on like this, the cave would collapsed, while those common people were still inside.</p>
		<p>In soothing tone, Wèi WúXiàn began, “Lán Zhàn, everything is all right now, those little monsters are already...” he suddenly paused, noticing that something was off.</p>
		<p>Then, he realised that Lán WàngJī just passed out, and quickly held him so to prevent him from falling on the ground.</p>
		<p>Outside the cave, Lán WàngJī’s attacks were felt as if it was an earthquake, shaking the ground violently. The vibration was so great that it made Lán JǐngYí wake up faster than the notes of Melody of Lucidity.</p>
		<p>Worried, Lán SīZhuī ran towards the entrance of the cave. However, before he could reached the entrance, Wèi WúXiàn rushed out of the cave, carrying Lán WàngJī on his back.</p>
		<p>Looking at the current state of Lán WàngJī, the three teenagers were at loss.</p>
		<p>Without further delay, Wèi WúXiàn told Jīn Líng and Lán JǐngYí to take care of the common people who were still inside the cave.</p>
		<p>And, since he could no longer use his sword, Wèi WúXiàn asked Lán SīZhuī to drive them back to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>Although not many people in Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù knew about Lán WàngJī’s condition, however, the matter was far to be trivial.</p>
		<p>Also, when they were back at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, the three teenagers, who didn’t know the details of what happened inside the cave, were even restless, while waiting outside Jingshi before being sent away.</p>
		<p>Right now, however, this unexpected turn of events caught Wèi WúXiàn and Lán XīChén off guard. Just a moment ago, they were worried while nursing the comatose Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>They didn’t expect him to suddenly wake up, let alone to behave like this; hugging his partner in front his uncle and brother, and refusing to let go of him.</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén frowned, as if he could not believe his eyes, and said, “How can he be in such a state just by the smell of wine?”</p>
		<p>“Uncle, although it sounds unbelievable, however, WàngJī’s case is an exception.” Lán XīChén commented, “It’s pity that WàngJī killed all the little monsters, and smashed all the jars that were filled with wine. Otherwise, we might have found some clues.”</p>
		<p>While stroking his goatee, Lán Qǐrén thought for a moment, then asked, “Have those people who were rescued regained consciousness?”</p>
		<p>“No, they’re still in state of stupor.” replied Lán XīChén, “Now right, our doctor is giving them medical treatment.”</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén nodded, and said, “In that case, when they recover their senses, listen to their accounts to see if you can learn more about this matter.”</p>
		<p>Then, he looked at Wèi WúXiàn who was hugged by his nephew. The scene was really awkward, no matter how you looked at it, and causing the veins of his temples to throb.</p>
		<p>He said, “Wèi Yīng, take WàngJī back to have some rest. And, for the time being, there is no need for him to give lessons.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn couldn’t agree more with what Lán Qǐrén just said, and hurriedly nodded his head.</p>
		<p>While turning to look at Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn was thinking that, once they returned to Jingshi, he would let Lán WàngJī do whatever he wanted, indulging him like a spoiled child.</p>
		<p>There would be no one around to watch them, and Lán WàngJī could take the advantage of being drunk to let himself go, doing what he wouldn’t normally dare to do.</p>
		<p>With difficulty, Wèi WúXiàn managed to free himself from Lán WàngJī’s grip around his waist, then, he smiled at him, and said, “Lán Zhàn, uncle said that we can go back to...”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn interrupted himself to listen to Lán WàngJī, who muttered, “Huh ... What ...?”</p>
		<p>However, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t hear every word that Lán WàngJī said.</p>
		<p>In the meantime, Lán Qǐrén felt suffocated just by watching them sitting so close together, and whispering to each other.</p>
		<p>And, when he was about to say something, Wèi WúXiàn asked in a coaxing voice, “Lán Zhàn, what did you said? Can you speak louder?”</p>
