			<p><b>Translator Note:</b></p>
			<p>This is another side story of Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn that has picked my interest.</p>
			<p>The original title, ‘Drunk HánGuāng-Jūn (醉叽含光君)’, for an English reader’s perspective, sounds like: 'He got drunk because he had drunk too much alcohol', which is not what the story is about.</p>
			<p>So, for not to confuse my readers, I've named this story: ‘Lán WàngJī versus Alcohol’.</p>
		</section>
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<p>It was the season for celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival*, the Osmanthus shrubs were in full bloom, and their golden flowers released their sweet fragrance.</p>
		<small>*Mid-Autumn Festival is a harvest festival celebrated in Chinese culture.</small>
		<p>Surrounded by the mountains on one side and a river on the other side, Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù* was located in an excellent neighbourhood.</p>
		<small>*Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù is the name of GūsūLán residence.</small>
		<p>The residence had luxuriant bamboos here and there, including in the courtyards of the dwellings. Some curative springs and streams were also found in Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.</p>
		<p>Since GūsūLán sect had strong moral principles, it had always produced talented cultivators, who drove away evil spirits and purified impure energy around Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù and its surroundings, so that, all year round, the all residence was wrapped with spiritual power.</p>
		<p>However, the three teenagers standing outside Jingshi* were too anxious to admire the scenery of this fairyland.</p>
		<small>*Jingshi, literally means quiet room, is Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn’s dwelling.</small>
		<p>They had returned from their Night Hunting, and were looking very messy with their clothes all covered with dust. However, their scruffy appearance was nothing compared to the anxiety that consumed them.</p>
		<p>Unable to stay still, Lán JǐngYí was pacing up and down, and, from time to time, he would crouch down and put his hands on the back of his head.</p>
		<p>Irritated, Jīn Líng said, “Lán JǐngYí, have you not done enough, already? My head is spinning just by watching you.”</p>
		<p>Looking at Jīn Líng, Lán JǐngYí loudly replied, “No, I haven’t!”</p>
		<p>Then, suddenly, it crossed his mind that he was at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù*, and, furthermore, he was standing outside Jingshi, so he quickly shut his mouth.</p>
		<small>*The rules of GūsūLán forbid to shout or to speak loudly.</small>
		<p>After a short pause, Lán JǐngYí said, “Can’t you see that I am worried. It has been almost four hours, and HánGuāng-Jūn hasn’t woken up yet, and Wèi-qiánbèi*...”</p>
		<small>*qiánbèi is a respectful title to someone older than you.</small>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī could not help but frown when he thought about the incident. However, in comparison with the two other teenagers, he had kept a cool head.</p>
		<p>He took a deep breath, and said, “It happened so suddenly, and, the fact that the demon didn’t have a high level of cultivation makes the matter more difficult to understand.</p>
		<p>“Besides, Wèi-qiánbèi said that there wasn’t any other evil spirits or formation at all. So, why HánGuāng-Jūn...”</p>
		<p>Noticing that Lán JǐngYí and Jīn Líng were looking at him, hanging on his lips, Lán SīZhuī resumed with a reassuring tone, “I think that HánGuāng-Jūn will be fine.”</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí remarked, “But it was HánGuāng-Jūn who received the blow, and he didn’t even notice it. What if the demon was actually very powerful.”</p>
		<p>With annoyance in his tone, Jīn Líng said, “Lán SīZhuī said that he will be fine, then everything will be all right. Since you have time to worry, why not think about what we have overlooked, instead.”</p>
		<p>“It’s easy for you to say. Why don’t you think about it yourself.” protested Lán JǐngYí.</p>
		<p>“You were the first to get inside the lair, and even stayed in there for a long time. If you don’t want to figure it out, who else will?” retorted Jīn Líng.</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí hit back, “I didn’t stayed that long. Besides, I fainted. Now that you mention it, didn’t you also get in there yourself, later on?”</p>
		<p>“You have the nerve to say that you fainted!” exclaimed Jīn Líng.</p>
		<p>“You didn’t faint, but you hadn’t noticed anything either.”  Lán JǐngYí counter-attacked.</p>
		<p>“Lán JǐngYí, if you are asking for a fight, just say so.” uttered Jīn Líng.</p>
		<p>As these two were about to start fighting, Lán SīZhuī, alarmed, said, “Hold on, both of you! You are not allowed to fight here, at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù!”</p>
		<p>“I want to fight, too. Which one of you wants to fight with me?”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn was standing on the threshold of Jingshi, looking at them, with his lips curved into a smile, while his eye were not smiling at all.</p>
		<p>He was wearing black clothes, which enhanced his svelte body, looking quite handsome with the sunlight showering on him.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn wanted to appear as gentle as possible, however, the suffocating pressure that emanated from him was almost palpable.</p>
		<p>He carried on, “Right now, I am very annoyed, however, for your sake, I promise not to beat you to death.”</p>
		<p>Out of fear, the three teenagers instantly kept quiet, looking like they could barely bear the pressure that was upon them.</p>
		<p>At that instance, a gentle voice came from the room, “WúXiàn, WàngJī will be fine. Don’t scare them.” It was Lán XīChén.</p>
		<p>His voice and words made Lán SīZhuī feel at ease. He wanted to ask something to Wèi WúXiàn, however, before he could talk, Wèi WúXiàn, said, “SīZhuī, you guys should go and get some rest.” then, he closed the door as soon as he finished talking.</p>
		<p>The three teenagers looked at each other and thought that it would be wiser to do what they had been told, and leave the rest to Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>As they left, Lán SīZhuī got someone to prepare a room for Jīn Líng.</p>
		<p>After closing the door, Wèi WúXiàn hurried to the bed, sat down on the edge of the bed, took Lán WàngJī’s arm, and, once more, he began attentively to probe his pulse in the wrist.</p>
		<p>After a short while, however, he still could not find any sign of abnormality. He heavily sighed, and put Lán WàngJī’s arm back under the duvet.</p>
		<p>Lying comatose in bed, Lán WàngJī’s facial expression was calm, and his breathing steady. There was no sign of any curse on him, or any external injury. But why was he still unconscious?</p>
		<p>The more Wèi WúXiàn thought about the incident the more puzzled he became. Without wandering his eyes away Lán WàngJī, he asked, “Dà-gē*, you didn’t notice anything either?”</p>
		<small>*Dà-gē means elder brother. However, bear in mind that it can have different meanings. For example, a gang leader can also be called Dà-gē, meaning boss.</small>
		<p>Lán XīChén calmly replied, “There is neither a presence of evil energy nor an external injury. Moreover, though his pulse is slightly faster, his spiritual power is as strong as ever, and he has not been poisoned either. It’s more like...”</p>
		<p>“It’s more like what?” Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly asked, looking at Lán XīChén.</p>
		<p>“I’m not quite sure.” replied Lán XīChén, “WúXiàn, don’t you think that something is off in this room?”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn looked at Lán XīChén with a perplexed expression in his face, “Something is off?”</p>
		<p>Since Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn become a couple, Jingshi had been modified to suit the needs and interests of Wèi WúXiàn, such as extending the wardrobe, as well as the bookshelf for his collection of books and other knick-knacks.</p>
		<p>There was also the hidden compartment under the floor where they put Emperor Smile*. Apart from these modifications, there was nothing unusual in the room.</p>
		<small>*Emperor Smile is Wèi WúXiàn’s favourite wine.</small>
		<p>However, after Lán XīChén’s remark, Wèi WúXiàn began to detect something. He sniffed the air of the room, and noticed that the sandalwood fragrance that filled the room all year round was now mixed with a hint of... alcohol?!</p>
		<p>Moreover, it was not the smell of Emperor Smile, and, on top of that, that smell of alcohol was emanating from Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>“Dà-gē, do you think that Lán Zhàn is... drunk?!” Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed rather than asking.</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén replied, “I have seen WàngJī being drunk before, and the rhythm of his pulse now is similar to when he is drunk.”</p>
		<p>He carried on, “WúXiàn, is it true that the monster you had encountered this time was very good at brewing wine?”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn muttered, “Indeed, the wine brewed by that monster had a very strong smell. JǐngYí was heavily intoxicated as soon as he entered the lair. However, even if Lán Zhàn...”</p>
		<p>He resumed after a short pause, “It is inconceivable that Lán Zhàn would faint just by smelling the wine.”</p>
		<p>Besides, no matter what kind of wine he had drunk before, he would wake up soon after falling asleep. Could it be that the monster’s wine was out of the ordinary?</p>
		<p>“Since it is a fact now that Lán Zhàn is drunk,” thought Wèi WúXiàn, “that will be difficult to handle it here, at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.</p>
		<p>“And, when Lán Zhàn is going to wake up and still drunk, the matter will get even worst. If I had known that fact, I wouldn’t have brought him directly here.”</p>
		<p>Noticing that Wèi WúXiàn’s facial expression had changed, Lán XīChén became a little bit concerned about Wèi WúXiàn’s emotional state.</p>
		<p>He knew that although Wèi WúXiàn was often carefree and unruly, he was also quick-witted and knowledgeable, as well as very good at Night Hunting.</p>
		<p>It was rare for Lán XīChén to see him so anxious. And he easily guessed what caused Wèi WúXiàn to look so upset.</p>
		<p>“Uncle has been informed on the matter, just after you guys came back.” said Lán XīChén, “WúXiàn, why don’t you come with me to consult him. He might shed light on this matter.”</p>
		<p>“That’s right!” thought Wèi WúXiàn, “Lán Lǎo* is highly respected and extremely knowledgeable. It’s a good idea to have his thought on this matter.”</p>
		<small>*Lán Qǐrén, also known as Lán Lǎo, is the uncle of Lán XīChén and Lán WàngJī.</small>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn then readily agreed, stood up, adjusted his clothes, tidied his hair, and there they were on their way to Lán Qǐrén’s dwelling.</p>
		<p>Upon their arrival, a disciple went to inform Lán Qǐrén, while they were waiting outside of the house.</p>
		<p>While thinking on how he should phrase the situation, Wèi WúXiàn adjusted his already-tidy collar once more, “I should not tell Lán Lǎo that Lán Zhàn is drunk right away. Recently, he seems to tolerate my living here. So, it’s better not to upset him.”</p>
		<p>As he carried on thinking, the disciple came out and said, “Zéwú-Jūn and Wèi-qiánbèi, Lán Lǎo is in the sitting room. Please come in, I will lead the way.”</p>
		<p>The two of them followed the disciple, and walked past the hall, then went all the way down the corridor, before reaching the sitting room.</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén was sitting at the centre of the room with his torso in an upright posture, watching them as they entered the room.</p>
		<p>“Sit down.” he said, and, straight to the point, he asked, “What is wrong with WàngJī?”</p>
		<p>“There is nothing wrong with him. It’s just that something is strange.” replied Lán XīChén.</p>
		<p>“What is strange?” asked Lán Qǐrén.</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén then narrated the sequence of events that happened, while Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn and youngsters were out doing their Night Hunting, as well as his examination of Lán WàngJī’s pulse.</p>
		<p>The more Wèi WúXiàn thought about it, the more he became convinced that Lán WàngJī was excessively intoxicated by the smell of the alcohol for him to lose consciousness.</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén also came to the same conclusion that Lán WàngJī was overly drunk. However, he didn’t say anything about it, because he feared that his uncle would get angry and blame it on Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén then called, “Wèi Yīng.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly straightened up his back, and, with a solemn expression on his face, he said, “Uncle, I am all ears.”</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén said, “Since you were also there with WàngJī, don’t you have anything else to say?”</p>
		<p>“As Dà-gē just said, that monster was good at brewing wine.” replied Wèi WúXiàn, “Moreover, its wine has been infiltrated and sold at the market.</p>
		<p>“Whoever drinks that wine will begin to hallucinate, and be unable to control their actions. And also, they will lose their memories after being manipulated by that monster.</p>
		<p>“Once we found out the hideout of that monster,  Lán Zhàn and I went immediately there, and besieged its lair.</p>
		<p>“Although the level of its cultivation was not high, however, the wine it brewed was very strong. It must have be aged for hundreds of years, and also, evil energy had been incorporated into the wine.</p>
		<p>“Since there was an overwhelming smell of alcohol inside the lair, it is likely that Lán Zhàn has been... affected by the smell.”</p>
		<p>Noting a displeased expression on Lán Qǐrén’s face, Wèi WúXiàn said inwardly, “I can’t just say: ‘Your nephew is very drunk. And the reason why he hasn’t woken up yet is because he can’t hold his liquor’.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn then thought again, “The smell of that wine was indeed very unusual. It seems to me that I can still smell it even right now.”</p>
		<p>As he was about to resume his account, Wèi WúXiàn saw Lán Qǐrén looking behind him, with his eyes wide open in surprise. Then, astonished, Lán XīChén exclaimed, “WàngJī?!”</p>
		<p>Before Wèi WúXiàn could turn around, Lán WàngJī had already sat down behind him, wrapped his arms tight around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist and leaned against his back.</p>
		<p>The fragrance of sandalwood that usually accompanied his embrace was now replaced by the smell of the monster’s wine.</p>
		<p>Inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn said, “No wonder why I just thought that I could smell that alcohol.”</p>
		<p>With Lán WàngJī embracing him in front of his uncle, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t dare to cast a glance in Lán Qǐrén’s direction. Instead, he hurriedly tried to set himself free from Lán WàngJī’s cuddle.</p>
		<p>He began, “Lán Zhàn...”</p>
		<p>Before Wèi WúXiàn could finish his sentence, Lán WàngJī tenderly kissed his forehead then his temple, as he always did when he woke up in the morning.</p>
		<p>Then, he buried his head behind Wèi WúXiàn’s neck, moving his lips up and down along Wèi WúXiàn’s nape in an arousing caress, while he kept on whispering his name, “Wèi Yīng.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn became dazed by Lán WàngJī’s kisses. He could feel the warm breath of Lán WàngJī mixed with the aroma of alcohol on the soft skin of his neck, which made him feel like his face was burning hot.</p>
		<p>When they were only the two of them, Wèi WúXiàn would readily respond to Lán WàngJī’s invitation. However, right here and right now was out of the question. Furthermore, Lán Qǐrén was about to faint.</p>
		<p>“What should I do now?” in panic, Wèi WúXiàn began thinking, “Is it too late to tell uncle that Lán Zhàn is drunk?</p>
		<p>“If I have known that thing would turn out like this, I wouldn’t have kept quiet about him being drunk.</p>
		<p>“And then again, how could I possibly guess that we would end up in this awkward situation.</p>
		<p>“As we speak, I can feel Lán Zhàn tightening more and more his embrace around my waist. And, since he is really drunk, I’m afraid that what comes next will be even more unacceptable.”</p>
		<p>“WàngJī, your behaviour is inappropriate. Let go of him, already!” thundered Lán Qǐrén.</p>
		<p>Usually, it was this unruly Wèi WúXiàn who would openly flirt with his nephew, since he had such a personality.</p>
		<p>However, ever since Wèi WúXiàn became Lán WàngJī’s partner, he had shown manners in front of him and the rest of the elders. And also, he often assisted and guided the young disciples during Night Hunting.</p>
		<p>So, in some occasions, when Wèi WúXiàn misbehaved, Lán Qǐrén would turn a blind eye. In contrast, his nephew had always an irreproachable conduct. So, why was he acting like this now?</p>
		<p>Seeing that his uncle got upset, and that Wèi WúXiàn’s attempt to free himself from Lán WàngJī’s arms failed, Lán XīChén hurriedly explained the situation, “Uncle, don’t get angry at him. WàngJī has been affected by the monster’s evil energy. That’s why he is behaving strangely.”</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén frowned, then uttered, “He has been affected by evil energy?”</p>
		<p>After a careful examination, Lán Qǐrén didn’t find any trace of evil energy in Lán WàngJī, instead, he detected the smell of alcohol emanating from Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>His nephew was very strict, he would not drink alcohol, especially when he was out doing Night Hunting, unless...</p>
		<p>Noting that Lán Qǐrén looked at him in a sceptical way, Wèi WúXiàn quickly said, “Uncle, Lán Zhàn didn’t drink any alcohol at all. That monster was relying on its wine to confuse people. I think the smell of its wine has the same effect. JǐngYí also passed out soon after entering the lair.”</p>
		<p>In order to teach the youngsters, Wèi WúXiàn had set a formation around the lair to block the monster’s actions, and placed a protection talisman on each of them to avoid a surprise attack.</p>
		<p>He had organised his training so that, in turn, each teenager would lead the way. And this Night Hunting was Lán JǐngYí’s turn to take the lead.</p>

		<br />
		<p>When the teenagers went Night Hunting with Wèi WúXiàn, they usually joked around to make them feel less nervous. This time, however, Lán WàngJī was there as well, so the atmosphere was intense.</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí was a little bit anxious, thinking that if he didn’t perform well he would definitely be punished later on. After unsheathing his sword, he entered the monster’s lair.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn had reminded him before getting inside the lair that if he noticed any anomaly, he should at once send the signal.</p>
		<p>Although the monster’s level of cultivation was not high, they must not drop their guard, because this was the first time they encountered a monster that used wine to lure people.</p>
		<p>Some time had elapsed since Lán JǐngYí went in, and no sound of fighting had been heard either.</p>
		<p>So, Lán WàngJī used his spiritual energy to probe the lair, then, frowning slightly, he said, “I didn’t detect the sound his footsteps.”</p>
		<p>“No sound of JǐngYí’s footsteps?” thought Wèi WúXiàn, “Something must have stopped him from moving forward.”</p>
		<p>Seeing that Lán WàngJī was about to enter the lair, Wèi WúXiàn stopped him by saying, “Lán Zhàn, the inside of the monster’s lair must be very dusty. It would be a shame if your white clothes get dirty. Leave it to me.” Then, he bent and entered the lair.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng decided to follow suit after thinking that he was there to learn and practise, so he couldn’t just stay there watching and do nothing.</p>
		<p>As soon as he penetrated into the lair, Wèi WúXiàn was welcomed with very strong aroma of wine.</p>
		<p>The smell was so extreme that it made even a wine lover like Wèi WúXiàn feel suffocated. As for Jīn Líng, he could not suppress a series of cough.</p>
		<p>Instinctively, Wèi WúXiàn felt that he had been targeted. He at once threw three talismans in front of him, and said, “Jīn Líng, find JǐngYí and carry him outside.”</p>
		<p>An angry roar came from where the talismans struck, then the red light produced by the talismans revealed where the monster was.</p>
		<p>A smirk appeared on Wèi WúXiàn’s face while looking at the monster, he resumed, “Don’t let Lán Zhàn or Lán SīZhuī get here, because they are not good at drinking. If they breathe this strong smell of alcohol, they will definitely faint.”</p>
		<p>Then, at leisure, he moved forward to confront the monster.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng began to cast about and find Lán JǐngYí close by, lying on the ground. He noticed that Lán JǐngYí had fainted, and could not help but roll his eyes.</p>
		<p>He then made Lán JǐngYí stand up by supporting him, so he could drag him out of the lair. As he began to move, Jīn Líng felt that something was preventing him from dragging Lán JǐngYí.</p>
		<p>He suddenly realised that Lán JǐngYí’s ankle was grabbed by something. Alarmed, Jīn Líng hit that thing with his palm. His attack made that thing to move backwards.</p>
		<p>He then drew Suìhuá* and swung it horizontally while still supporting Lán JǐngYí. His sword produced a bright light that illuminated his surroundings.</p>
		<small>*Suìhuá is the name of Jīn Líng’s sword.</small>
		<p>Seeing who was his opponents, Jīn Líng’s eyes widened in surprise; unexpectedly, there were common people inside the lair of the monster!</p>
		<p>He also noticed that they didn’t act of their own free will, they seemed to be manipulated to attack him. And, since they were common people, Jīn Líng knew that he could not use Suìhuá against them.</p>
		<p>So, he calmed himself down, sheathed his sword, and started to kick away those who were getting close to attack him.</p>
		<p>To his surprise, Jīn Líng noted that they seemed not to feel pain at all, and kept coming towards him.</p>
		<p>To avoid hurting those people, Jīn Líng was not using his full strength. However, after a while, he felt that the situation was hopeless.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn also had to deal with many puppets, while the monster was hiding itself behind them.</p>
		<p>However, the talismans on the monster’s body helped Wèi WúXiàn to locate it. It was just a matter of time before it got caught.</p>
		<p>A red light flashed from Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes, as he narrowed them. And, all of a sudden, the inside of the lair became eerie; Wèi WúXiàn had summoned dark energy along with demons. And, like a rope, that energy tied up all those puppets.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng let out a sigh of relief, then, he asked, “Why are there so many common people in here, as well as the souls of dead people?”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn laughed, then replied, “That’s because there are so many drunkards.”</p>
		<p>While joking, Wèi WúXiàn was actually using Chénqíng* to also control countless of dead people’s souls, so that he could stop them from roaming inside the lair, and, peacefully, dispatch them from this world.</p>
		<small>*Chénqíng is the name of Wèi WúXiàn’s flute.</small>
		<p>After a quick observation, Wèi WúXiàn came to the conclusion that the presence of those souls indicated that many people had be killed here by the monster, while those who were still alive must had been brought here recently.</p>
		<p>Also, the smell of the corpses had been overpowered by the strong smell of the wine. No wonder Wèi WúXiàn didn’t detect any smell of those who were slaughtered by the monster.</p>
		<p>“Tut.” Wèi WúXiàn said inwardly, “This is the first time I find that the smell of alcohol can also be disgusting.”</p>
		<p>Then, skilfully spinning Chénqíng between his fingers, which, in turn, gracefully swayed the red tassel attached at one end of the flute, Wèi WúXiàn got close to the monster that was now held down by the dark energy.</p>
		<p>He said, “It’s rare to see a monster that can brew wine. I would love to capture you alive, and study your abilities. But...”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn paused, and then waved Chénqíng. As a result, the dark energy strangled the monster until the sound of the broken bones could be heard.</p>
		<p>In a cold tone, he resumed, “it’s pity that you have done too much of evil deeds.”</p>
		<p>As soon as he finished speaking, the demons, which were summoned and waiting for that moment, rushed to devour the monster. And, the very next instant, there was nothing left of it.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn then joined Jīn Líng, and, with a smile on his face, he asked, “Are you scared?”</p>
		<p>“I... I’m not scared.”  Jīn Líng quickly replied.</p>
		<p>“If you are not scared, why are you still standing here, then?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng replied, “That’s because Lán JǐngYí is too heavy.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn shook his head helplessly, and said, “If you can’t even handle his weight, then, you will need to practise harder.” Wèi WúXiàn remarked.</p>
		<p>Then, he turned around and glanced at those people who were now looking like the zombies. He suddenly felt gloomy just by observing their states.</p>
		<p>“I can’t use Chénqíng to control the living being.” he thought, “If I do, in order to guide them out of the lair, I’m afraid that it would damage their brains.”</p>
		<p>He carried on thinking, “If I want to bring them to their senses, I will need Lán Zhàn to play his Melody of Lucidity.”</p>
		<p>After pondering for a short while, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Jīn Líng, ask Lán Zhàn to expand the entrance in order to let the fresh air in, and the smell of the wine out. Meanwhile, I will explore the cave.”</p>
		<p>Soon after Jīn Líng left the lair dragging the unconscious Lán JǐngYí, Wèi WúXiàn heard a continuous sound of a sword hitting the entrance of the cave.</p>
		<p>He cautiously lit a touch. He didn’t do it before because he was afraid that it might cause an explosion due to the smell of the alcohol in the air.</p>
		<p>As he surveyed the inside of the lair, Wèi WúXiàn found hundreds of jars containing wine. “No wonder there is a lasting smell of alcohol inside the cave.” he said.</p>
		<p>He carried on, “In order to find out what is wrong with this wine, I should take a few jars to study the wine later on, when we get back home.”</p>
		<p>As he was about to pick up a jar, Wèi WúXiàn felt like something brushed his fingers, and he quickly reacted by moving a few steps backwards.</p>
		<p>Then, in front of him, he saw a little creature jumped out from a jar, and rushed towards him. At the same time, other little creatures, one by one, were coming out of their respective jars.</p>
		<p>As they did so, the jars lost balance, knocking the adjacent ones, and, one after another, they crashed on the ground, with a continuous loud smash.</p>
		<p>Some of the jars that contained wine fell on the ground as well, which released more smell of alcohol inside the lair.</p>
		<p>“This cave is actually a den of monsters!” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn , “That monster had in fact gave birth to such a larger group of offspring!”</p>
		<p>There was no time to ponder. After extinguishing the touch, Wèi WúXiàn quickly played some notes on his flute with the intention of catching them all at once.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, after listening to Jīn Líng’s account, checking Lán JǐngYí’s condition, and asking Lán SīZhuī to play Melody of Lucidity to wake him up, Lán WàngJī widened the entrance of the lair, and was now waiting for the smell of wine to dissipate, when, all of a sudden, he heard the piercing sound of Chénqíng.</p>
		<p>Before Jīn Líng could stop him, Lán WàngJī, alarmed, rushed into the cave.</p>
		<p>Since the smell of the alcohol inside the lair had become more stronger than before, due to the wine that splashed onto the floor, Lán WàngJī felt a sudden splitting headache just by inhaling the smell.</p>
		<p>He shook his head, trying to suppress the pain, then quickly moved further down the cave.</p>
		<p>In the darkness, Lán WàngJī discerned countless of pairs of green eyes, which surrounded the slender figure blowing into the flute.</p>
		<p>Seized with terror, Lán WàngJī summoned WàngJī*, and quickly strummed his fingers on the guqin, which caused the seven strings to vibrate violently.</p>
		<small>*WàngJī is the name of Lán WàngJī’s guqin.</small>
		<p>Like a weapon, the sound emitted by WàngJī caused those little monsters to howl in pain.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn was not only startled but also noticed that something was not quite right with the notes that Lán WàngJī produced.</p>
		<p>As he turned around, he saw Lán WàngJī, who was almost running towards him, then, he held him tight in his arms.</p>
		<p>While hugging Wèi WúXiàn, Lán WàngJī, in silence, was gritting his teeth, with a frown between his eyebrows.</p>
		<p>Noting that something was wrong with Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn became worried, and tried to free himself from his hug in order to examine him carefully, but failed.</p>
		<p>Then, all of a sudden, Lán WàngJī raised his head, and slowly looked around, then fixed his gaze at Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn recognised the look on Lán WàngJī’s face. It was the same look that Lán WàngJī had, from time to time, when he woke up from a nightmare.</p>
		<p>When it happened, Lán WàngJī would desperately hold him tight, and then, he would gaze at him in daze, with that look on his face.</p>
		<p>“Lán Zhàn?” in a low voice, Wèi WúXiàn called. </p>
		<p>With his lips slightly trembling, Lán WàngJī was still looking at him in stupor.</p>
		<p>Then, suddenly, he turned around, shielded Wèi WúXiàn with his body, summoned WàngJī once again, and, this time, he produced some blue spiritual strings that pierced through the darkness.</p>
		<p>The blue strings hit the wall of the cave, and blew up some segment of the wall.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly stopped him from striking again, because, if he carried on like this, the cave would collapsed, while those common people were still inside.</p>
		<p>In soothing tone, Wèi WúXiàn began, “Lán Zhàn, everything is all right now, those little monsters are already...” he suddenly paused, noticing that something was off.</p>
		<p>Then, he realised that Lán WàngJī just passed out, and quickly held him so to prevent him from falling on the ground.</p>
		<p>Outside the cave, Lán WàngJī’s attacks were felt as if it was an earthquake, shaking the ground violently. The vibration was so great that it made Lán JǐngYí wake up faster than the notes of Melody of Lucidity.</p>
		<p>Worried, Lán SīZhuī ran towards the entrance of the cave. However, before he could reached the entrance, Wèi WúXiàn rushed out of the cave, carrying Lán WàngJī on his back.</p>
		<p>Looking at the current state of Lán WàngJī, the three teenagers were at loss.</p>
		<p>Without further delay, Wèi WúXiàn told Jīn Líng and Lán JǐngYí to take care of the common people who were still inside the cave.</p>
		<p>And, since he could no longer use his sword, Wèi WúXiàn asked Lán SīZhuī to drive them back to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>Although not many people in Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù knew about Lán WàngJī’s condition, however, the matter was far to be trivial.</p>
		<p>Also, when they were back at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, the three teenagers, who didn’t know the details of what happened inside the cave, were even restless, while waiting outside Jingshi before being sent away.</p>
		<p>Right now, however, this unexpected turn of events caught Wèi WúXiàn and Lán XīChén off guard. Just a moment ago, they were worried while nursing the comatose Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>They didn’t expect him to suddenly wake up, let alone to behave like this; hugging his partner in front his uncle and brother, and refusing to let go of him.</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén frowned, as if he could not believe his eyes, and said, “How can he be in such a state just by the smell of wine?”</p>
		<p>“Uncle, although it sounds unbelievable, however, WàngJī’s case is an exception.” Lán XīChén commented, “It’s pity that WàngJī killed all the little monsters, and smashed all the jars that were filled with wine. Otherwise, we might have found some clues.”</p>
		<p>While stroking his goatee, Lán Qǐrén thought for a moment, then asked, “Have those people who were rescued regained consciousness?”</p>
		<p>“No, they’re still in state of stupor.” replied Lán XīChén, “Now right, our doctor is giving them medical treatment.”</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén nodded, and said, “In that case, when they recover their senses, listen to their accounts to see if you can learn more about this matter.”</p>
		<p>Then, he looked at Wèi WúXiàn who was hugged by his nephew. The scene was really awkward, no matter how you looked at it, and causing the veins of his temples to throb.</p>
		<p>He said, “Wèi Yīng, take WàngJī back to have some rest. And, for the time being, there is no need for him to give lessons.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn couldn’t agree more with what Lán Qǐrén just said, and hurriedly nodded his head.</p>
		<p>While turning to look at Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn was thinking that, once they returned to Jingshi, he would let Lán WàngJī do whatever he wanted, indulging him like a spoiled child.</p>
		<p>There would be no one around to watch them, and Lán WàngJī could take the advantage of being drunk to let himself go, doing what he wouldn’t normally dare to do.</p>
		<p>With difficulty, Wèi WúXiàn managed to free himself from Lán WàngJī’s grip around his waist, then, he smiled at him, and said, “Lán Zhàn, uncle said that we can go back to...”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn interrupted himself to listen to Lán WàngJī, who muttered, “Huh ... What ...?”</p>
		<p>However, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t hear every word that Lán WàngJī said.</p>
		<p>In the meantime, Lán Qǐrén felt suffocated just by watching them sitting so close together, and whispering to each other.</p>
		<p>And, when he was about to say something, Wèi WúXiàn asked in a coaxing voice, “Lán Zhàn, what did you said? Can you speak louder?”</p>

		<br />
		<p>Lán Qǐrén couldn’t take it any longer, and uttered, “It is forbidden to make noise at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù and... ”</p>
		<p>Before he could finish reciting the rule, he heard Lán WàngJī saying, “Dizzy.” His voice was low and hoarse.</p>
		<p>Paying no heed to Lán Qǐrén’s reminder, Wèi WúXiàn tenderly cupped Lán WàngJī’s cheeks, and exclaimed, “You are feeling dizzy! How could that be? You had been sleeping for four hours.”</p>
		<p>Then, still holding Lán WàngJī’s face, Wèi WúXiàn leaned his head towards him so that his forehead could be in contact with Lán WàngJī’s forehead, then, he maintained this posture for a short while before saying, “You don’t have a fever.”</p>
		<p>Like an overprotective parent, Wèi WúXiàn carried on, “Lán Zhàn, do you feel pain anywhere else?”</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī didn’t reply directly. He first looked into Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes, then put his forehead against his, just like Wèi WúXiàn did before, and then, in a low voice, he replied, “Headache.”</p>
		<p>Without realising what he was doing, Wèi WúXiàn began gently to rub his forehead against Lán WàngJī’s forehead, while saying, “Then, let’s go back to Jingshi, so that you can lie down for a while.”</p>
		<p>He then adjusted Lán WàngJī’s collar, smoothed a wrinkle from it, and added, “Or, how about eating first before resting? You haven’t eaten anything yet.”</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén felt that if these two were still here, flirting shamelessly in front of him, he would have a headache, as well.</p>
		<p>And, as he was about to send them away, he saw Lán WàngJī imitating Wèi WúXiàn by brushing his forehead against his. Then, he heard him saying, “Come with me.”</p>
		<p>“Of course, I’ll go with you. I can’t let you go and rest by yourself.” Wèi WúXiàn reassured him.</p>
		<p>“Let’s eat together.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>“All right.” agreed Wèi WúXiàn, then, he added, “Èr-gēge*, I’m starving, let’s hurry up.”</p>
		<small>*Èr-gēge means second brother (every second son of a family can be called like that).</small>
		<p>Lán XīChén looked at them with amusement, then, with a smile, he said, “WúXiàn, and WàngJī, you guys must be tired from your Night Hunting. You should go back and get some rest. If we find out any new detail about this matter, uncle and I will let you know.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly said, “Thank you, Dà-gē. I’ll leave it you.”</p>
		<p>After they both stood up, Wèi WúXiàn tugged at Lán WàngJī’s sleeve to signal him that, it was time for them to leave.</p>
		<p>At that instant, Lán WàngJī seemed to act as usual. He bowed while saying, “Xiōng-zhǎng*, thank you so much for your trouble.”</p>
		<small>*Xiōng-zhǎng means elder brother (it’s more formal than Dà-gē).</small>
		<p>Seeing that Lán Qǐrén’s face became gloomy, Wèi WúXiàn suppressed a chuckle, and secretly stuck his tongue out at him, then, he said inwardly, “Sorry, Lán Lǎo, I didn’t mean to upset you.”</p>
		<p>Then, he thought to himself, “I should now be more careful not to add fuel to the fire, otherwise, Lán Zhàn will be punished by copying the GūsūLán rules when he becomes sober.”</p>
		<p>“Also,” he carried on, “if Lán Zhàn learned that he had behaved like a spoiled child in front of his uncle and brother, he would die with embarrassment.”</p>
		<p>Picturing Lán WàngJī overly embarrassed, Wèi WúXiàn held back from laughing aloud, as much as he could.</p>
		<p>When he was about to take him away, Wèi WúXiàn paused as he saw Lán WàngJī leaning towards him. Then, he suddenly realised what Lán WàngJī intended to do, but it was too later.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī had put one arm around Wèi WúXiàn’s back, and the other behind Wèi WúXiàn’s knees, then, lifting him and holding him in his arms, he walked towards the door.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn was horrified, he didn’t even dare to cast a glance at Lán Qǐrén. Then, before Lán WàngJī could reach the door, Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly said, “Lán Zhàn, put me down. There are many disciples out there.”</p>
		<p>As a result of what Wèi WúXiàn just said, Lán WàngJī suddenly stopped walking and stood still. It seemed as if he was thinking whether it matted or not.</p>
		<p>Seeing that, Wèi WúXiàn thought that he could coax him, however, before he could say something, Lán WàngJī began to let go of him in the way that Wèi WúXiàn would fall directly on the floor.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn was startled, and, instinctively, he hugged Lán WàngJī around the neck.</p>
		<p>This scene left uncle and brother speechless.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī seemed fully satisfied with this outcome; his beloved one had no more arguments to put forward, and obediently let him hold him in his arms.</p>
		<p>With his white clothes moving gracefully, Lán WàngJī walked out of his uncle’s sitting room.</p>
		<p>While watching his young brother leaving with Wèi WúXiàn in his arms, Lán XīChén thought, “WàngJī  can also behave like a spoiled child. It’s a good thing that he is less strict in front of the one he loves.”</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén was wondering if they had forgotten that he was still in the room.</p>
		<p>The disciple who was standing outside the sitting room tried to look as normal as possible, as he saw them walked past him.</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī who usually didn’t show signs of fatigue, this time, however, felt exhausted after eating and bathing. As for Lán JǐngYí, he quickly fell asleep.</p>
		<p>For more than half a month, they had been busy doing Night Hunting under the supervision of Wèi WúXiàn, acquiring a lot of knowledge and experience along the way. And Lán JǐngYí didn’t feel tired at the beginning.</p>
		<p>During their Night Hunting, Wèi WúXiàn never acted like a senior. He was always in a playful mood, narrating stories in the funniest way, and making them laugh all the time. He also said witty remarks that got them excited to show their skills.</p>
		<p>Three days prior to their return home, they heard that people from Lánlíng and Yúnmèng territories went missing, while others seemed either to be in a confused state, or not to remember what happened to them.</p>
		<p>The incidents occurred in various locations across the territory, which attracted attention of many sects of the cultivation world.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī also heard about the incidents. And, since Wèi WúXiàn and himself had already agreed to meet three days before their return, he went down to join them.</p>
		<p>With Lán WàngJī being there for supervising as well, Wèi WúXiàn was as lively as ever, while, nervous, the teenagers followed the rules.</p>
		<p>After a lengthy investigation, they had finally located the whereabouts of the monster.</p>
		<p>At that time, Lán SīZhuī thought that they would quickly solve the problem caused by that monster, then go back home. However, no one was expecting that turn of events.</p>
		<p>The scene where Wèi WúXiàn came out of the cave with Lán WàngJī on his back replayed in Lán SīZhuī’s head. Wèi WúXiàn seemed to be calm while instructing Jīn Líng and Lán JǐngYí.</p>
		<p>However, Lán SīZhuī noticed a profound sadness in Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes when he said to him, “Sorry, SīZhuī , I’ll trouble you to give us a ride back home on your sword.”</p>
		<p>Pulling himself together, Lán SīZhuī gathered his spiritual power to make his sword hover close to the ground, then, when they stepped on it, the sword flew at high altitude.</p>
		<p>Using his spiritual power in fully, Lán SīZhuī drove his sword as fast as he could. This was the first time he ever flew at such high speed. The blue light produced by his sword was like lightning crossing the sky.</p>
		<p>Even though Wèi WúXiàn didn’t urge him to speed up, Lán SīZhuī was only thinking of driving faster and faster.</p>
		<p>Throughout the whole journey back home, Wèi WúXiàn remained silent.</p>
		<p>As he drove them back, Lán SīZhuī said inwardly, “Both of them must have at one point suffered more than I could imagine. It must have been tough for them to attain a happy life they have now. So, I won’t let any misfortune happen to them again.”</p>
		<p>Even now, in the quiet of his room, when recalling the anxiety he read on Wèi WúXiàn’s face at that time, Lán SīZhuī felt his heart still ached.</p>
		<p>A groan of pain interrupted his thought. It was Lán JǐngYí who was moaning in his sleep. Lán SīZhuī walked to his bed and noticed that he was having a bad dream.</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí was gritting his teeth, his face had turned pale, and his forehead was covered with beads of sweat. The grimace of his face was similar to when he was dragged out of the monster’s lair.</p>
		<p>“Could it be that JǐngYí had seen something inside the cave back then, but didn’t have any recollection of it?” thought Lán SīZhuī.</p>
		<p>He hurried to wake him up from his nightmare, “JǐngYí? Wake up!”</p>
		<p>After calling him, shaking him, and even slapping him on the face a few times, Lán SīZhuī failed to wake him up. Without further delay, he reached for his guqin and began to play Melody of Lucidity.</p>
		<p>After a short while, Lán SīZhuī began to see changes in Lán JǐngYí’s condition; he had stopped groaning, and, gradually, his face expression became calm and relaxed.</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī was about to heave a sigh of relief when, suddenly, he detected a smell of alcohol in the room. Lán SīZhuī was shocked because it was the same smell that was coming out of that monster’s lair. He quickly played a sharp tune to ward off whatever it was.</p>
		<p>As a result, Lán JǐngYí’s body shook, then the smell of wine rapidly dissipated. Lán SīZhuī seemed to think of something, then, he got close to check on Lán JǐngYí, and noted that he was fine.</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī was finally relieved, then thought again, and came to a conclusion that the smell of wine was acting like an evil spirit, sneaking into someone’s body to disturb their mind.</p>
		<p>“But why Jīn Líng and Wèi-qiánbèi were not affected at all?” Lán SīZhuī pondered, “Not only they entered the cave, but also stayed there long enough.”</p>
		<p>He then put away his guqin, and was no longer feeling sleepy after all this. He felt the need of discussing this matter with someone, and, since Lán JǐngYí was still asleep, he thought he could go and see if Jīn Líng was awake.</p>
		<p>At that precise moment, he heard a loud ‘bang’ sound, and the door was flung open.</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí was woken by that blaring noise, almost jumped up from his bed.</p>
		<p>With a look of stupefaction on his face, Lán SīZhuī looked in the direction of the door, and saw Jīn Líng standing in the doorway, noting that he was undeniably very annoyed.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng thundered, “What the hell is going on here? Can you guys not let your guest sleep quietly? Is it not forbidden to make noise at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, according to your GūsūLán rules?”</p>
		<p>After taking a bath, Jīn Líng was about to go to bed when he received a letter from Jiāng Chéng, his uncle. As soon as he finished reading the letter, Jīn Líng’s mind began to race, then, after a while, he seemed to have understood something.</p>
		<p>Since he had been thinking for quite a while, as a result, Jīn Líng was having a hard time to find sleep.</p>
		<p>Then, suddenly, he heard someone shouting, followed by a gentle tune, and then, there was a piercing sound, and Jīn Líng had had enough.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng’s eyes scanned the room, and he saw Lán JǐngYí with a drowsy face lying in bed, which caused him to become even more upset, he uttered, “Lán JǐngYí, are you a dormouse? You still fall asleep after being unconscious for so long.”</p>
		<p>He then added, “Since I’m here, why don’t you get out of bed already?” Then, the very next instant, a quarrel between them broke out.</p>
		<p>After squabbling over what Jīn Líng said to him, and how he caused him to wake up, the two of them finally calmed down, and sat at the table along with Lán SīZhuī. Then, Jīn Líng told them about the letter he received.</p>
		<p>“Jīn Zōng-zhǔ*, according to what you just said, Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ sent you an update on the events that happened a few days ago.” Lán SīZhuī remarked, “In other words, there is some change in those who were affected by that monster’s wine.”</p>
		<small>*Zōng-zhǔ means leader of a sect.</small>
		<p>Jīn Líng affirmed, “That’s right. It seems that three of those common people from Yúnmèng territory have recovered from their state of stupor.”</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí were baffled.</p>
		<p>Then, Lán JǐngYí asked, “How did they regain consciousness? No one in YúnmèngJiāng sect knows how to play Melody of Lucidity.”</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī remarked, “Although I use my guqin to make people sober, it is in fact very difficult to achieve. I wonder what kind of method Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ used to make them regain consciousness.”</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng pulled off a small round bell from his waist belt, and replied, “By using this.” while showing them the spherical bell.</p>
		<p>He carried, “This Qīngxīn-líng is used by YúnmèngJiāng sect, and has the effect of calming people’s mind. Moreover, Wèi WúXiàn added into it a very powerful talisman that repels evil spirits.</p>
		<p>“Those, who have regained consciousness, don’t usually drink alcohol, and if they do, they only consume a small amount of it. Therefore, they were not greatly affected, which, in turn, made them recover much faster than others.</p>
		<p>“My uncle noticed that soon after using Qīngxīn-líng on them, the smell of wine, which was emanated from them, will suddenly vanish.”</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī thought, then exclaimed, “That’s right!” He seemed to talk to himself rather than to others.</p>
		<p>Noticing that two pairs of eyes were fixed on him, Lán SīZhuī said, “You both know that Wèi-qiánbèi put talismans on each of us except on HánGuāng-Jūn, back then. I think he didn’t plan on letting him get inside the cave.</p>
		<p>“So, that will explain why HánGuāng-Jūn’s condition seems to be more serious than JǐngYí ’s, even though JǐngYí stayed inside much longer than HánGuāng-Jūn.”</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí pondered, then said, “SīZhuī, with the high level of HánGuāng-Jūn’s cultivation, do you really think he also needed Wèi-qiánbèi to put a talisman on him?</p>
		<p>“Besides, HánGuāng-Jūn stayed there only for a short period of time, and also eliminated all those monsters. As a result, when Jīn Líng and I went inside to get those people out of the cave, there was no more smell of wine in there.”</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng commented, “No matter how powerful HánGuāng-Jūn is, he is still a human being. Also, unlike both of you who sometimes drink alcohol, his alcohol tolerance is worst than yours.</p>
		<p>“Moreover, didn’t you see those broken jars? This means that the smell of wine must have been much stronger at that time. So, even though HánGuāng-Jūn didn’t stay there longer, it was enough for him to be affected by the smell.</p>
		<p>“Besides, the first time you went in, you didn’t go deeper into the cave, you fainted close to the entrance. So, it’s normal that your case was not serious.”</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī thought, then said, “This matter is not that simple.”</p>
		<p>“SīZhuī, what do you mean by that?” Lán JǐngYí asked, “Have you figured out something else?”</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī replied, “I think that the smell of that monster’s wine is like a resentment. It can evoke someone’s dreadful memories, making people relive those memories, which can be worse than a nightmare.”</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí was extremely shocked. In dismay, he said, “But Wèi-qiánbèi and Zéwú-Jūn said that HánGuāng-Jūn will be fine.”</p>

		<br />
		<p>Jīn Líng said, “My uncle also said that among those three cases, there was a woman who, as soon as she has regained consciousness, was asking after her child.</p>
		<p>“People close to her said that when she was in confused state, she kept saying: ‘My child is dead’, but her child is safe and sound.</p>
		<p>“It turns out that, in the past, she had lost a child. If we follow your reasoning, it will mean that the woman must have been dreaming about the past events.”</p>
		<p>“It’s probably true.” said Lán SīZhuī, “Earlier, when JǐngYí had a bad dream, I recognised the terrified expression on his face; it was the same expression he had when he was frightened by a fierce corpse, which was hanging upside down from the ceiling.</p>
		<p>“JǐngYí, do you remember that time?”</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí remained silent as if he was lost in thought.</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī carried on, “Since I couldn’t wake you up, I played Melody of Lucidity. Then, when you got better, there was suddenly a smell of wine in the room. It felt like resentful energy. So, I played an aggressive tune, and the smell vanished.”</p>
		<p>“Is that so?” said Lán JǐngYí, “So many things happened while I was sleeping. Did HánGuāng-Jūn also see some terrifying event before losing consciousness?”</p>
		<p>Suddenly, the room fell into dead silence, following Lán JǐngYí’s question. Although it sounded improbable, however, Lán SīZhuī and Jīn Líng knew that it was most likely to be the case.</p>
		<p>Seeing the other two remained silent, Lán JǐngYí scratched his head, wondering if he had said something wrong.</p>
		<p>He carried on, “I can hardly imagine HánGuāng-Jūn being afraid of something.”</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng frowned. He didn’t know what to say, and kept quiet.</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī wanted to say something but he hesitated. He then dropped his gaze and said inwardly, “It’s not hard to imagine what HánGuāng-Jūn is afraid of.</p>
		<p>“Throughout those thirteen years, after giving lessons, he would go Night Hunting. And, late at night, after he finished correcting assignments, he would stay quietly in his room, plucking at the strings of his guqin.</p>
		<p>“When watching him, even all you could see was his back, you still could feel his loneliness.</p>
		<p>“So, whatever HánGuāng-Jūn had seen while he was in the cave must be related to the same fear back then.</p>
		<p>“However, this time, I am sure that HánGuāng-Jūn will be fine, because Wèi-qiánbèi is by his side.”</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>For the first in his life, Wèi WúXiàn truly appreciated the existence of the three thousands rules of GūsūLán, especially the two that forbade their people: to talk behind someone’s back and to make noises, which helped him cope with the overwhelming embarrassment that he felt at this moment.</p>
		<p>Running into two young disciples on their way back to Jingshi, Wèi WúXiàn hid his face that had already turned red, as he saw that they were shocked but didn’t dare to speak, only bowed their heads, and quickly moved away.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn tried  as much as he could to attract less attention to himself, however, in the pale background of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, his iconic black clothes was an eye-catching, let alone being in Lán WàngJī’s arms.</p>
		<p>Inwardly, he said, “Young boys, it’s not that I want to corrupt your innocence or chastity. It’s just that I can’t handle Lán Zhàn when he is drunk. He is too strong for me, and once he set up his mind to do something, he won’t give in, no matter what.”</p>
		<p>And, when he struggled to free himself from his arms, Lán WàngJī held him even more tight, and looked at him with fondness. In his eyes, Wèi WúXiàn also read a hint of sadness, that he could not bear, and eventually chose to indulge him.</p>
		<p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn begged him to walk much faster, so that they could quickly reach their dwelling. However, much to his surprise, Lán WàngJī did just the opposite; slowing down his pace, and taking all his time.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, Lán WàngJī seemed to have made a long detour, passing by the locations where there were usually many people, such as the front of Orchid Room*.</p>
		<small>*Orchid Room is the name of GūsūLán classroom.</small>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn put a hand on his forehead, and, inwardly, said to himself, “Oh my! How did it slip my mind that when Lán Zhàn is drunk, he turns a deaf ear to everything that he doesn’t want to hear?”</p>
		<p>Fortunately, there was no lecture today, and most of the disciples, included those from other sects who came to study at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, were in the library. Only a few youngsters were outside, walking around.</p>
		<p>The only two things that Wèi WúXiàn could do were submissively letting Lán WàngJī carry him, and patiently waiting for them to reach Jingshi.</p>
		<p>With a dignified expression on his face, Lán WàngJī walked slowly on the paved paths of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù. And, occasionally, when Wèi WúXiàn stirred in his arms, he would stopped walking, looked at him with tenderness, then resumed walking.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn had leaned his head against Lán WàngJī’s shoulder, and the gentle fragrance of sandalwood emanated from Lán WàngJī wrapped around him.</p>
		<p>He started to look at Lán WàngJī’s white and graceful neck, then up to the smooth curve of his jaws, and then, his eyes lingered at Lán WàngJī’s profile, while thinking that he would never get tired of looking at his face.</p>
		<p>Then, as some Lán WàngJī’s long hair had slipped in front, Wèi WúXiàn began to twist it with his fingers.</p>
		<p>As he carried on fiddling with Lán WàngJī’s hair, Wèi WúXiàn replayed Lán WàngJī’s behaviour in his mind; each time they met some disciples on their way; he would stop and wait for them to bow, and walk away with a surprising expression on their faces.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn’s lips curved into a smile while rerunning those scenes in his head.</p>
		<p>His facial expression seemed to reflect a feeling of satisfaction. The more Wèi WúXiàn thought about Lán WàngJī’s behaviour, the cuter he looked.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī noticed the warm smile of Wèi WúXiàn. He stopped, looked at him, and smiled as well. This time, there was no trace of sadness in his crystal-like eyes,</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn blinked, because he wasn’t sure if Lán WàngJī was still drunk. So, he held up two fingers in front of Lán WàngJī, and asked, “Èr-gēge, how many fingers?”</p>
		<p>The first thing that crossed Lán WàngJī’s mind was to grab Wèi WúXiàn’s fingers with his both hands. However, he realised that if he did so, it would require him to let go of Wèi WúXiàn, which he definitely didn’t want to do. So, he replied, “Two.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn read him like an open book, and suppressed a chuckle, he then said, “Well done! Here, I’ll give you a reward.”</p>
		<p>In a coquettish manner, Wèi WúXiàn wrapped his arms around Lán WàngJī’s neck, and kissed him on the cheek.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī’s heart skipped a beat, his eyes widened, his ears turned red, and his Adam’s apple bobbed up and down.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn amusingly said inwardly, “As time goes by, it’s getting harder to see this reaction when I tease Lán Èr-gōngzǐ*. But now that he is drunk not only he becomes frank and stubborn, but also he has this innocent expression of a teenager. This is quite interesting.”</p>
		<small>*gōngzǐ is an honorific title for a son of a noble family.</small>
		<p>Very excited, Wèi WúXiàn, in a teasing way, asked, “Why, all of a sudden, do you become so timid?” Then, since Lán WàngJī didn’t react, he said, “If that is so, then put me down.”</p>
		<p>At the moment he heard Wèi WúXiàn’s last words, Lán WàngJī pulled himself together, held him even more tight, and loudly said, “I won’t.”</p>
		<p>Then, he seemed to remember that it was not allowed to raise one’s voice, which caused him to be embarrassed. And, as a result, he began to walk much faster.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn was delighted by that result, then, he said, “Not bad at all. Hurry up, or else...”</p>
		<p>Instead of completing his sentence, Wèi WúXiàn moved his head close to his, then kissed Lán WàngJī’s earlobe.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī almost stumbled, he stopped to establish his balance, then resumed walking. His pace was as fast as the wind, causing his white clothes to flutter.</p>
		<p>Then, he heard Wèi WúXiàn whispering to his ear, “If you don’t hurry up, I’ll keep kissing you until we reach Jingshi.”</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>Some disciples who were coming out of the library saw, like a comet crossing the sky, a bright light produced by the silver sword, heading towards Jingshi, and was accompanied by a melodious laughter, which was very heartwarming.</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>Lán WàngJī’s heart was beating very fast, and despite the layers of his high quality clothes, the throb of his heartbeat could not be concealed, and were easy sensed by Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>Looking at Lán WàngJī who was desperately rushing towards their room at a high speed, because he was aroused by him, Wèi WúXiàn smile froze, thinking that he might have gone too far this time. But there was no other way.</p>
		<p>On top of that, every time when he saw Lán WàngJī who was usually calm and well-mannered losing control of himself because of him, Wèi WúXiàn could not help but keep teasing him.</p>
		<p>And, each time it happened, Wèi WúXiàn was like seized by a feeling of a great accomplishment, he said inwardly, “Lán Zhàn’s current state of arousal is caused by me.”</p>
		<p>After saying that to himself, all traces of guilt were swept away from his face. He even licked his lips with excitement.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī seemed to have reached his limit. As soon as he landed, he grabbed his sword, then, on second thought, he threw the top-grade spiritual sword on the ground without ceremony, thinking that it was too much of a hindrance.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes widened in surprise. Then, he pretended to be shocked, and said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, don’t you want Bìchén* any longer? Why are you in such a rush?”</p>
		<small>*Bìchén is the name of Lán WàngJī’s sword.</small>
		<p>Without paying attention to what Wèi WúXiàn was saying, Lán WàngJī stormed into the room, and carried him straight to the bedroom. Immediately after he laid Wèi WúXiàn on the bed, Lán WàngJī also got on the bed with his body pressed down on Wèi WúXiàn’s body.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī was breathing heavily, while trying to control his sexual urge. Meanwhile, Wèi WúXiàn was getting turned on by Lán WàngJī’s warm breath brushing the soft skin of his neck.</p>
		<p>He put his hands on Lán WàngJī’s back, and began gentle to run his fingers. Now that he was no longer worried about Lán WàngJī’s condition, Wèi WúXiàn wanted to be held tight.</p>
		<p>Even if Lán WàngJī held him too tight to the point of feeling pain, it was preferable than to see him lying unconscious in the bed.</p>
		<p>Inhaling the usual fragrance of sandalwood, Wèi WúXiàn let out a long sigh of relief, then, he whispered on Lán WàngJī’s ear, “Lán Zhàn, next time, don’t do this so suddenly, I...”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn interrupted himself as he saw Lán WàngJī raising his head to look at him. He noted that Lán WàngJī’s ears were still red, however, he was no longer in a hurry to hold him like he usually did.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī’s golden eyes were fixed at Wèi WúXiàn intensely, as though he wanted to know if it was okay for him to carry on holding him.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn’s feeling of uneasiness came back to his mind. He had a gut feeling that something was not quite right with Lán WàngJī. He looked at him with a puzzled expression in his face, then, he called out, “Lán Zhàn?”</p>
		<p>At that instant, Lán WàngJī began to stroke Wèi WúXiàn hair, then brush one of his eyebrows, he carried on caressing Wèi WúXiàn’s cheek, and then, his slender fingers touched Wèi WúXiàn’s slightly parted, sensual lips.</p>
		<p>At the moment he run his fingers on Wèi WúXiàn’s lips, Lán WàngJī suddenly stopped, and the rhythm of his breathing became chaotic.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn was now certain that something was definitely wrong with Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>Usually, he would kiss and hold him without hesitation. After all, they were a couple, and had an intimate relationship.</p>
		<p>It was not like at the beginning of their relationship when, sometimes, Lán WàngJī would show some hesitation or shyness in touching Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, when Lán WàngJī was drunk, he wouldn’t hesitate even for an instant to kiss Wèi WúXiàn earnestly. Dominant, he wouldn’t let Wèi WúXiàn escape from his hold.</p>
		<p>So, why did he, even being drunk, become hesitant?</p>
		<p>“Wait a minute!” Wèi WúXiàn seemed to think hard, “The way Lán Zhàn hugged me inside the cave, and the look on his face when he stared at me were strange. And, earlier, when he held me in the sitting room of Lán Lǎo, could it be that...”</p>
		<p>Putting his both hands against Lán WàngJī’s chest, Wèi WúXiàn began, “Lán Zhàn, are you...”</p>
		<p>Without warning, Lán WàngJī interrupted Wèi WúXiàn with a sudden kiss. And the latter could easily feel that Lán WàngJī was trembling uncontrollably.</p>
		<p>Then, as if he was afraid that Wèi WúXiàn would resist him, Lán WàngJī firmly wrapped his arm around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist, while his other hand held the back of Wèi WúXiàn’s head.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī’s kisses were first gentle, then quickly became more intense, showing his fierce desire. He kissed Wèi WúXiàn with passion and fury, and, like always, making him unable to resist his caress.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn didn’t expect to be kissed so suddenly, and in the way Lán WàngJī usually kissed him.</p>
		<p>However, he held him more tight than usual that Wèi WúXiàn could barely move. He managed to free his arms, and wrapped them around Lán WàngJī’s shoulders.</p>
		<p>But Lán WàngJī misunderstood his gesture, thinking that Wèi WúXiàn was trying to resist him, and pressed down on Wèi WúXiàn’s body even more.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn found it difficult to breath under Lán WàngJī’s strong embrace. He let out weak sound of pain, however, since his mouth was covered by Lán WàngJī’s kisses, it sounded like a lustful moan.</p>
		<p>As a result, Lán WàngJī became even more enticed by the moan, sucking Wèi WúXiàn’s tongue, twisting his own tongue around his fiercely.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī’s tongue was hot and insatiable, sweeping each inch of Wèi WúXiàn’s mouth in a voracious way. Their both lips kept on intertwining, while their heads tossing and turning continuously.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn found it harder and harder to breathe properly. Being out of breath, Wèi WúXiàn’s chest was moving up and down rapidly. His grip around Lán WàngJī’s shoulders loosed, and his arms began slowly to slide down.</p>
		<p>Lack of sleep and adequate breathing caused Wèi WúXiàn to suddenly feel dizzy, and his whole body gradually became weak.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī noticed the change on Wèi WúXiàn, and withdrew his tongue from his mouth. Then, he began gently to lick Wèi WúXiàn’s lips to let him catch his breath.</p>
		<p>As was his habit, Lán WàngJī bit Wèi WúXiàn’s lower lip, which was slightly swollen by his intense kisses. Then, he raised his head to look at Wèi WúXiàn who became so horny that his facial expression caused sexual arousal.</p>
