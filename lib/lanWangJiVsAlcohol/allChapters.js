			<p><b>Translator Note:</b></p>
			<p>This is another side story of Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn that has picked my interest.</p>
			<p>The original title, ‘Drunk HánGuāng-Jūn (醉叽含光君)’, for an English reader’s perspective, sounds like: 'He got drunk because he had drunk too much alcohol', which is not what the story is about.</p>
			<p>So, for not to confuse my readers, I've named this story: ‘Lán WàngJī versus Alcohol’.</p>
		</section>
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<p>It was the season for celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival*, the Osmanthus shrubs were in full bloom, and their golden flowers released their sweet fragrance.</p>
		<small>*Mid-Autumn Festival is a harvest festival celebrated in Chinese culture.</small>
		<p>Surrounded by the mountains on one side and a river on the other side, Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù* was located in an excellent neighbourhood.</p>
		<small>*Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù is the name of GūsūLán residence.</small>
		<p>The residence had luxuriant bamboos here and there, including in the courtyards of the dwellings. Some curative springs and streams were also found in Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.</p>
		<p>Since GūsūLán sect had strong moral principles, it had always produced talented cultivators, who drove away evil spirits and purified impure energy around Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù and its surroundings, so that, all year round, the all residence was wrapped with spiritual power.</p>
		<p>However, the three teenagers standing outside Jingshi* were too anxious to admire the scenery of this fairyland.</p>
		<small>*Jingshi, literally means quiet room, is Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn’s dwelling.</small>
		<p>They had returned from their Night Hunting, and were looking very messy with their clothes all covered with dust. However, their scruffy appearance was nothing compared to the anxiety that consumed them.</p>
		<p>Unable to stay still, Lán JǐngYí was pacing up and down, and, from time to time, he would crouch down and put his hands on the back of his head.</p>
		<p>Irritated, Jīn Líng said, “Lán JǐngYí, have you not done enough, already? My head is spinning just by watching you.”</p>
		<p>Looking at Jīn Líng, Lán JǐngYí loudly replied, “No, I haven’t!”</p>
		<p>Then, suddenly, it crossed his mind that he was at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù*, and, furthermore, he was standing outside Jingshi, so he quickly shut his mouth.</p>
		<small>*The rules of GūsūLán forbid to shout or to speak loudly.</small>
		<p>After a short pause, Lán JǐngYí said, “Can’t you see that I am worried. It has been almost four hours, and HánGuāng-Jūn hasn’t woken up yet, and Wèi-qiánbèi*...”</p>
		<small>*qiánbèi is a respectful title to someone older than you.</small>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī could not help but frown when he thought about the incident. However, in comparison with the two other teenagers, he had kept a cool head.</p>
		<p>He took a deep breath, and said, “It happened so suddenly, and, the fact that the demon didn’t have a high level of cultivation makes the matter more difficult to understand.</p>
		<p>“Besides, Wèi-qiánbèi said that there wasn’t any other evil spirits or formation at all. So, why HánGuāng-Jūn...”</p>
		<p>Noticing that Lán JǐngYí and Jīn Líng were looking at him, hanging on his lips, Lán SīZhuī resumed with a reassuring tone, “I think that HánGuāng-Jūn will be fine.”</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí remarked, “But it was HánGuāng-Jūn who received the blow, and he didn’t even notice it. What if the demon was actually very powerful.”</p>
		<p>With annoyance in his tone, Jīn Líng said, “Lán SīZhuī said that he will be fine, then everything will be all right. Since you have time to worry, why not think about what we have overlooked, instead.”</p>
		<p>“It’s easy for you to say. Why don’t you think about it yourself.” protested Lán JǐngYí.</p>
		<p>“You were the first to get inside the lair, and even stayed in there for a long time. If you don’t want to figure it out, who else will?” retorted Jīn Líng.</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí hit back, “I didn’t stayed that long. Besides, I fainted. Now that you mention it, didn’t you also get in there yourself, later on?”</p>
		<p>“You have the nerve to say that you fainted!” exclaimed Jīn Líng.</p>
		<p>“You didn’t faint, but you hadn’t noticed anything either.”  Lán JǐngYí counter-attacked.</p>
		<p>“Lán JǐngYí, if you are asking for a fight, just say so.” uttered Jīn Líng.</p>
		<p>As these two were about to start fighting, Lán SīZhuī, alarmed, said, “Hold on, both of you! You are not allowed to fight here, at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù!”</p>
		<p>“I want to fight, too. Which one of you wants to fight with me?”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn was standing on the threshold of Jingshi, looking at them, with his lips curved into a smile, while his eyes were not smiling at all.</p>
		<p>He was wearing black clothes, which enhanced his svelte body, looking quite handsome with the sunlight showering on him.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn wanted to appear as gentle as possible, however, the suffocating pressure that emanated from him was almost palpable.</p>
		<p>He carried on, “Right now, I am very annoyed, however, for your sake, I promise not to beat you to death.”</p>
		<p>Out of fear, the three teenagers instantly kept quiet, looking like they could barely bear the pressure that was upon them.</p>
		<p>At that instance, a gentle voice came from the room, “WúXiàn, WàngJī will be fine. Don’t scare them.” It was Lán XīChén.</p>
		<p>His voice and words made Lán SīZhuī feel at ease. He wanted to ask something to Wèi WúXiàn, however, before he could talk, Wèi WúXiàn, said, “SīZhuī, you guys should go and get some rest.” then, he closed the door as soon as he finished talking.</p>
		<p>The three teenagers looked at each other and thought that it would be wiser to do what they had been told, and leave the rest to Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>As they left, Lán SīZhuī got someone to prepare a room for Jīn Líng.</p>
		<p>After closing the door, Wèi WúXiàn hurried to the bed, sat down on the edge of the bed, took Lán WàngJī’s arm, and, once more, he began attentively to probe his pulse in the wrist.</p>
		<p>After a short while, however, he still could not find any sign of abnormality. He heavily sighed, and put Lán WàngJī’s arm back under the duvet.</p>
		<p>Lying comatose in bed, Lán WàngJī’s facial expression was calm, and his breathing steady. There was no sign of any curse on him, or any external injury. But why was he still unconscious?</p>
		<p>The more Wèi WúXiàn thought about the incident the more puzzled he became. Without wandering his eyes away Lán WàngJī, he asked, “Dà-gē*, you didn’t notice anything either?”</p>
		<small>*Dà-gē means elder brother. However, bear in mind that it can have different meanings. For example, a gang leader can also be called Dà-gē, meaning boss.</small>
		<p>Lán XīChén calmly replied, “There is neither a presence of evil energy nor an external injury. Moreover, though his pulse is slightly faster, his spiritual power is as strong as ever, and he has not been poisoned either. It’s more like...”</p>
		<p>“It’s more like what?” Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly asked, looking at Lán XīChén.</p>
		<p>“I’m not quite sure.” replied Lán XīChén, “WúXiàn, don’t you think that something is off in this room?”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn looked at Lán XīChén with a perplexed expression in his face, “Something is off?”</p>
		<p>Since Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn become a couple, Jingshi had been modified to suit the needs and interests of Wèi WúXiàn, such as extending the wardrobe, as well as the bookshelf for his collection of books and other knick-knacks.</p>
		<p>There was also the hidden compartment under the floor where they put Emperor Smile*. Apart from these modifications, there was nothing unusual in the room.</p>
		<small>*Emperor Smile is Wèi WúXiàn’s favourite wine.</small>
		<p>However, after Lán XīChén’s remark, Wèi WúXiàn began to detect something. He sniffed the air of the room, and noticed that the sandalwood fragrance that filled the room all year round was now mixed with a hint of... alcohol?!</p>
		<p>Moreover, it was not the smell of Emperor Smile, and, on top of that, that smell of alcohol was emanating from Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>“Dà-gē, do you think that Lán Zhàn is... drunk?!” Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed rather than asking.</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén replied, “I have seen WàngJī being drunk before, and the rhythm of his pulse now is similar to when he is drunk.”</p>
		<p>He carried on, “WúXiàn, is it true that the monster you had encountered this time was very good at brewing wine?”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn muttered, “Indeed, the wine brewed by that monster had a very strong smell. JǐngYí was heavily intoxicated as soon as he entered the lair. However, even if Lán Zhàn...”</p>
		<p>He resumed after a short pause, “It is inconceivable that Lán Zhàn would faint just by smelling the wine.”</p>
		<p>Besides, no matter what kind of wine he had drunk before, he would wake up soon after falling asleep. Could it be that the monster’s wine was out of the ordinary?</p>
		<p>“Since it is a fact now that Lán Zhàn is drunk,” thought Wèi WúXiàn, “that will be difficult to handle it here, at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.</p>
		<p>“And, when Lán Zhàn is going to wake up and still drunk, the matter will get even worst. If I had known that fact, I wouldn’t have brought him directly here.”</p>
		<p>Noticing that Wèi WúXiàn’s facial expression had changed, Lán XīChén became a little bit concerned about Wèi WúXiàn’s emotional state.</p>
		<p>He knew that although Wèi WúXiàn was often carefree and unruly, he was also quick-witted and knowledgeable, as well as very good at Night Hunting.</p>
		<p>It was rare for Lán XīChén to see him so anxious. And he easily guessed what caused Wèi WúXiàn to look so upset.</p>
		<p>“Uncle has been informed on the matter, just after you guys came back.” said Lán XīChén, “WúXiàn, why don’t you come with me to consult him. He might shed light on this matter.”</p>
		<p>“That’s right!” thought Wèi WúXiàn, “Lán Lǎo* is highly respected and extremely knowledgeable. It’s a good idea to have his thought on this matter.”</p>
		<small>*Lán Qǐrén, also known as Lán Lǎo, is the uncle of Lán XīChén and Lán WàngJī.</small>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn then readily agreed, stood up, adjusted his clothes, tidied his hair, and there they were on their way to Lán Qǐrén’s dwelling.</p>
		<p>Upon their arrival, a disciple went to inform Lán Qǐrén, while they were waiting outside of the house.</p>
		<p>While thinking on how he should phrase the situation, Wèi WúXiàn adjusted his already-tidy collar once more, “I should not tell Lán Lǎo that Lán Zhàn is drunk right away. Recently, he seems to tolerate my living here. So, it’s better not to upset him.”</p>
		<p>As he carried on thinking, the disciple came out and said, “Zéwú-Jūn and Wèi-qiánbèi, Lán Lǎo is in the sitting room. Please come in, I will lead the way.”</p>
		<p>The two of them followed the disciple, and walked past the hall, then went all the way down the corridor, before reaching the sitting room.</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén was sitting at the centre of the room with his torso in an upright posture, watching them as they entered the room.</p>
		<p>“Sit down.” he said, and, straight to the point, he asked, “What is wrong with WàngJī?”</p>
		<p>“There is nothing wrong with him. It’s just that something is strange.” replied Lán XīChén.</p>
		<p>“What is strange?” asked Lán Qǐrén.</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén then narrated the sequence of events that happened, while Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn and youngsters were out doing their Night Hunting, as well as his examination of Lán WàngJī’s pulse.</p>
		<p>The more Wèi WúXiàn thought about it, the more he became convinced that Lán WàngJī was excessively intoxicated by the smell of the alcohol for him to lose consciousness.</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén also came to the same conclusion that Lán WàngJī was overly drunk. However, he didn’t say anything about it, because he feared that his uncle would get angry and blame it on Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén then called, “Wèi Yīng.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly straightened up his back, and, with a solemn expression on his face, he said, “Uncle, I am all ears.”</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén said, “Since you were also there with WàngJī, don’t you have anything else to say?”</p>
		<p>“As Dà-gē just said, that monster was good at brewing wine.” replied Wèi WúXiàn, “Moreover, its wine has been infiltrated and sold at the market.</p>
		<p>“Whoever drinks that wine will begin to hallucinate, and be unable to control their actions. And also, they will lose their memories after being manipulated by that monster.</p>
		<p>“Once we found out the hideout of that monster,  Lán Zhàn and I went immediately there, and besieged its lair.</p>
		<p>“Although the level of its cultivation was not high, however, the wine it brewed was very strong. It must have be aged for hundreds of years, and also, evil energy had been incorporated into the wine.</p>
		<p>“Since there was an overwhelming smell of alcohol inside the lair, it is likely that Lán Zhàn has been... affected by the smell.”</p>
		<p>Noting a displeased expression on Lán Qǐrén’s face, Wèi WúXiàn said inwardly, “I can’t just say: ‘Your nephew is very drunk. And the reason why he hasn’t woken up yet is because he can’t hold his liquor’.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn then thought again, “The smell of that wine was indeed very unusual. It seems to me that I can still smell it even right now.”</p>
		<p>As he was about to resume his account, Wèi WúXiàn saw Lán Qǐrén looking behind him, with his eyes wide open in surprise. Then, astonished, Lán XīChén exclaimed, “WàngJī?!”</p>
		<p>Before Wèi WúXiàn could turn around, Lán WàngJī had already sat down behind him, wrapped his arms tight around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist and leaned against his back.</p>
		<p>The fragrance of sandalwood that usually accompanied his embrace was now replaced by the smell of the monster’s wine.</p>
		<p>Inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn said, “No wonder why I just thought that I could smell that alcohol.”</p>
		<p>With Lán WàngJī embracing him in front of his uncle, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t dare to cast a glance in Lán Qǐrén’s direction. Instead, he hurriedly tried to set himself free from Lán WàngJī’s cuddle.</p>
		<p>He began, “Lán Zhàn...”</p>
		<p>Before Wèi WúXiàn could finish his sentence, Lán WàngJī tenderly kissed his forehead then his temple, as he always did when he woke up in the morning.</p>
		<p>Then, he buried his head behind Wèi WúXiàn’s neck, moving his lips up and down along Wèi WúXiàn’s nape in an arousing caress, while he kept on whispering his name, “Wèi Yīng.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn became dazed by Lán WàngJī’s kisses. He could feel the warm breath of Lán WàngJī mixed with the aroma of alcohol on the soft skin of his neck, which made him feel like his face was burning hot.</p>
		<p>When they were only the two of them, Wèi WúXiàn would readily respond to Lán WàngJī’s invitation. However, right here and right now was out of the question. Furthermore, Lán Qǐrén was about to faint.</p>
		<p>“What should I do now?” in panic, Wèi WúXiàn began thinking, “Is it too late to tell uncle that Lán Zhàn is drunk?</p>
		<p>“If I have known that thing would turn out like this, I wouldn’t have kept quiet about him being drunk.</p>
		<p>“And then again, how could I possibly guess that we would end up in this awkward situation.</p>
		<p>“As we speak, I can feel Lán Zhàn tightening more and more his embrace around my waist. And, since he is really drunk, I’m afraid that what comes next will be even more unacceptable.”</p>
		<p>“WàngJī, your behaviour is inappropriate. Let go of him, already!” thundered Lán Qǐrén.</p>
		<p>Usually, it was this unruly Wèi WúXiàn who would openly flirt with his nephew, since he had such a personality.</p>
		<p>However, ever since Wèi WúXiàn became Lán WàngJī’s partner, he had shown manners in front of him and the rest of the elders. And also, he often assisted and guided the young disciples during Night Hunting.</p>
		<p>So, in some occasions, when Wèi WúXiàn misbehaved, Lán Qǐrén would turn a blind eye. In contrast, his nephew had always an irreproachable conduct. So, why was he acting like this now?</p>
		<p>Seeing that his uncle got upset, and that Wèi WúXiàn’s attempt to free himself from Lán WàngJī’s arms failed, Lán XīChén hurriedly explained the situation, “Uncle, don’t get angry at him. WàngJī has been affected by the monster’s evil energy. That’s why he is behaving strangely.”</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén frowned, then uttered, “He has been affected by evil energy?”</p>
		<p>After a careful examination, Lán Qǐrén didn’t find any trace of evil energy in Lán WàngJī, instead, he detected the smell of alcohol emanating from Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>His nephew was very strict, he would not drink alcohol, especially when he was out doing Night Hunting, unless...</p>
		<p>Noting that Lán Qǐrén looked at him in a sceptical way, Wèi WúXiàn quickly said, “Uncle, Lán Zhàn didn’t drink any alcohol at all. That monster was relying on its wine to confuse people. I think the smell of its wine has the same effect. JǐngYí also passed out soon after entering the lair.”</p>
		<p>In order to teach the youngsters, Wèi WúXiàn had set a formation around the lair to block the monster’s actions, and placed a protection talisman on each of them to avoid a surprise attack.</p>
		<p>He had organised his training so that, in turn, each teenager would lead the way. And this Night Hunting was Lán JǐngYí’s turn to take the lead.</p>

		<br />
		<p>When the teenagers went Night Hunting with Wèi WúXiàn, they usually joked around to make them feel less nervous. This time, however, Lán WàngJī was there as well, so the atmosphere was intense.</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí was a little bit anxious, thinking that if he didn’t perform well he would definitely be punished later on. After unsheathing his sword, he entered the monster’s lair.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn had reminded him before getting inside the lair that if he noticed any anomaly, he should at once send the signal.</p>
		<p>Although the monster’s level of cultivation was not high, they must not drop their guard, because this was the first time they encountered a monster that used wine to lure people.</p>
		<p>Some time had elapsed since Lán JǐngYí went in, and no sound of fighting had been heard either.</p>
		<p>So, Lán WàngJī used his spiritual energy to probe the lair, then, frowning slightly, he said, “I didn’t detect the sound his footsteps.”</p>
		<p>“No sound of JǐngYí’s footsteps?” thought Wèi WúXiàn, “Something must have stopped him from moving forward.”</p>
		<p>Seeing that Lán WàngJī was about to enter the lair, Wèi WúXiàn stopped him by saying, “Lán Zhàn, the inside of the monster’s lair must be very dusty. It would be a shame if your white clothes get dirty. Leave it to me.” Then, he bent and entered the lair.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng decided to follow suit after thinking that he was there to learn and practise, so he couldn’t just stay there watching and do nothing.</p>
		<p>As soon as he penetrated into the lair, Wèi WúXiàn was welcomed with very strong aroma of wine.</p>
		<p>The smell was so extreme that it made even a wine lover like Wèi WúXiàn feel suffocated. As for Jīn Líng, he could not suppress a series of cough.</p>
		<p>Instinctively, Wèi WúXiàn felt that he had been targeted. He at once threw three talismans in front of him, and said, “Jīn Líng, find JǐngYí and carry him outside.”</p>
		<p>An angry roar came from where the talismans struck, then the red light produced by the talismans revealed where the monster was.</p>
		<p>A smirk appeared on Wèi WúXiàn’s face while looking at the monster, he resumed, “Don’t let Lán Zhàn or Lán SīZhuī get here, because they are not good at drinking. If they breathe this strong smell of alcohol, they will definitely faint.”</p>
		<p>Then, at leisure, he moved forward to confront the monster.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng began to cast about and find Lán JǐngYí close by, lying on the ground. He noticed that Lán JǐngYí had fainted, and could not help but roll his eyes.</p>
		<p>He then made Lán JǐngYí stand up by supporting him, so he could drag him out of the lair. As he began to move, Jīn Líng felt that something was preventing him from dragging Lán JǐngYí.</p>
		<p>He suddenly realised that Lán JǐngYí’s ankle was grabbed by something. Alarmed, Jīn Líng hit that thing with his palm. His attack made that thing to move backwards.</p>
		<p>He then drew Suìhuá* and swung it horizontally while still supporting Lán JǐngYí. His sword produced a bright light that illuminated his surroundings.</p>
		<small>*Suìhuá is the name of Jīn Líng’s sword.</small>
		<p>Seeing who was his opponents, Jīn Líng’s eyes widened in surprise; unexpectedly, there were common people inside the lair of the monster!</p>
		<p>He also noticed that they didn’t act of their own free will, they seemed to be manipulated to attack him. And, since they were common people, Jīn Líng knew that he could not use Suìhuá against them.</p>
		<p>So, he calmed himself down, sheathed his sword, and started to kick away those who were getting close to attack him.</p>
		<p>To his surprise, Jīn Líng noted that they seemed not to feel pain at all, and kept coming towards him.</p>
		<p>To avoid hurting those people, Jīn Líng was not using his full strength. However, after a while, he felt that the situation was hopeless.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn also had to deal with many puppets, while the monster was hiding itself behind them.</p>
		<p>However, the talismans on the monster’s body helped Wèi WúXiàn to locate it. It was just a matter of time before it got caught.</p>
		<p>A red light flashed from Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes, as he narrowed them. And, all of a sudden, the inside of the lair became eerie; Wèi WúXiàn had summoned dark energy along with demons. And, like a rope, that energy tied up all those puppets.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng let out a sigh of relief, then, he asked, “Why are there so many common people in here, as well as the souls of dead people?”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn laughed, then replied, “That’s because there are so many drunkards.”</p>
		<p>While joking, Wèi WúXiàn was actually using Chénqíng* to also control countless of dead people’s souls, so that he could stop them from roaming inside the lair, and, peacefully, dispatch them from this world.</p>
		<small>*Chénqíng is the name of Wèi WúXiàn’s flute.</small>
		<p>After a quick observation, Wèi WúXiàn came to the conclusion that the presence of those souls indicated that many people had be killed here by the monster, while those who were still alive must had been brought here recently.</p>
		<p>Also, the smell of the corpses had been overpowered by the strong smell of the wine. No wonder Wèi WúXiàn didn’t detect any smell of those who were slaughtered by the monster.</p>
		<p>“Tut.” Wèi WúXiàn said inwardly, “This is the first time I find that the smell of alcohol can also be disgusting.”</p>
		<p>Then, skilfully spinning Chénqíng between his fingers, which, in turn, gracefully swayed the red tassel attached at one end of the flute, Wèi WúXiàn got close to the monster that was now held down by the dark energy.</p>
		<p>He said, “It’s rare to see a monster that can brew wine. I would love to capture you alive, and study your abilities. But...”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn paused, and then waved Chénqíng. As a result, the dark energy strangled the monster until the sound of the broken bones could be heard.</p>
		<p>In a cold tone, he resumed, “it’s pity that you have done too much of evil deeds.”</p>
		<p>As soon as he finished speaking, the demons, which were summoned and waiting for that moment, rushed to devour the monster. And, the very next instant, there was nothing left of it.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn then joined Jīn Líng, and, with a smile on his face, he asked, “Are you scared?”</p>
		<p>“I... I’m not scared.”  Jīn Líng quickly replied.</p>
		<p>“If you are not scared, why are you still standing here, then?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng replied, “That’s because Lán JǐngYí is too heavy.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn shook his head helplessly, and said, “If you can’t even handle his weight, then, you will need to practise harder.” Wèi WúXiàn remarked.</p>
		<p>Then, he turned around and glanced at those people who were now looking like the zombies. He suddenly felt gloomy just by observing their states.</p>
		<p>“I can’t use Chénqíng to control the living being.” he thought, “If I do, in order to guide them out of the lair, I’m afraid that it would damage their brains.”</p>
		<p>He carried on thinking, “If I want to bring them to their senses, I will need Lán Zhàn to play his Melody of Lucidity.”</p>
		<p>After pondering for a short while, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Jīn Líng, ask Lán Zhàn to expand the entrance in order to let the fresh air in, and the smell of the wine out. Meanwhile, I will explore the cave.”</p>
		<p>Soon after Jīn Líng left the lair dragging the unconscious Lán JǐngYí, Wèi WúXiàn heard a continuous sound of a sword hitting the entrance of the cave.</p>
		<p>He cautiously lit a touch. He didn’t do it before because he was afraid that it might cause an explosion due to the smell of the alcohol in the air.</p>
		<p>As he surveyed the inside of the lair, Wèi WúXiàn found hundreds of jars containing wine. “No wonder there is a lasting smell of alcohol inside the cave.” he said.</p>
		<p>He carried on, “In order to find out what is wrong with this wine, I should take a few jars to study the wine later on, when we get back home.”</p>
		<p>As he was about to pick up a jar, Wèi WúXiàn felt like something brushed his fingers, and he quickly reacted by moving a few steps backwards.</p>
		<p>Then, in front of him, he saw a little creature jumped out from a jar, and rushed towards him. At the same time, other little creatures, one by one, were coming out of their respective jars.</p>
		<p>As they did so, the jars lost balance, knocking the adjacent ones, and, one after another, they crashed on the ground, with a continuous loud smash.</p>
		<p>Some of the jars that contained wine fell on the ground as well, which released more smell of alcohol inside the lair.</p>
		<p>“This cave is actually a den of monsters!” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn , “That monster had in fact gave birth to such a larger group of offspring!”</p>
		<p>There was no time to ponder. After extinguishing the touch, Wèi WúXiàn quickly played some notes on his flute with the intention of catching them all at once.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, after listening to Jīn Líng’s account, checking Lán JǐngYí’s condition, and asking Lán SīZhuī to play Melody of Lucidity to wake him up, Lán WàngJī widened the entrance of the lair, and was now waiting for the smell of wine to dissipate, when, all of a sudden, he heard the piercing sound of Chénqíng.</p>
		<p>Before Jīn Líng could stop him, Lán WàngJī, alarmed, rushed into the cave.</p>
		<p>Since the smell of the alcohol inside the lair had become more stronger than before, due to the wine that splashed onto the floor, Lán WàngJī felt a sudden splitting headache just by inhaling the smell.</p>
		<p>He shook his head, trying to suppress the pain, then quickly moved further down the cave.</p>
		<p>In the darkness, Lán WàngJī discerned countless of pairs of green eyes, which surrounded the slender figure blowing into the flute.</p>
		<p>Seized with terror, Lán WàngJī summoned WàngJī*, and quickly strummed his fingers on the guqin, which caused the seven strings to vibrate violently.</p>
		<small>*WàngJī is the name of Lán WàngJī’s guqin.</small>
		<p>Like a weapon, the sound emitted by WàngJī caused those little monsters to howl in pain.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn was not only startled but also noticed that something was not quite right with the notes that Lán WàngJī produced.</p>
		<p>As he turned around, he saw Lán WàngJī, who was almost running towards him, then, he held him tight in his arms.</p>
		<p>While hugging Wèi WúXiàn, Lán WàngJī, in silence, was gritting his teeth, with a frown between his eyebrows.</p>
		<p>Noting that something was wrong with Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn became worried, and tried to free himself from his hug in order to examine him carefully, but failed.</p>
		<p>Then, all of a sudden, Lán WàngJī raised his head, and slowly looked around, then fixed his gaze at Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn recognised the look on Lán WàngJī’s face. It was the same look that Lán WàngJī had, from time to time, when he woke up from a nightmare.</p>
		<p>When it happened, Lán WàngJī would desperately hold him tight, and then, he would gaze at him in daze, with that look on his face.</p>
		<p>“Lán Zhàn?” in a low voice, Wèi WúXiàn called. </p>
		<p>With his lips slightly trembling, Lán WàngJī was still looking at him in stupor.</p>
		<p>Then, suddenly, he turned around, shielded Wèi WúXiàn with his body, summoned WàngJī once again, and, this time, he produced some blue spiritual strings that pierced through the darkness.</p>
		<p>The blue strings hit the wall of the cave, and blew up some segment of the wall.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly stopped him from striking again, because, if he carried on like this, the cave would collapsed, while those common people were still inside.</p>
		<p>In soothing tone, Wèi WúXiàn began, “Lán Zhàn, everything is all right now, those little monsters are already...” he suddenly paused, noticing that something was off.</p>
		<p>Then, he realised that Lán WàngJī just passed out, and quickly held him so to prevent him from falling on the ground.</p>
		<p>Outside the cave, Lán WàngJī’s attacks were felt as if it was an earthquake, shaking the ground violently. The vibration was so great that it made Lán JǐngYí wake up faster than the notes of Melody of Lucidity.</p>
		<p>Worried, Lán SīZhuī ran towards the entrance of the cave. However, before he could reached the entrance, Wèi WúXiàn rushed out of the cave, carrying Lán WàngJī on his back.</p>
		<p>Looking at the current state of Lán WàngJī, the three teenagers were at loss.</p>
		<p>Without further delay, Wèi WúXiàn told Jīn Líng and Lán JǐngYí to take care of the common people who were still inside the cave.</p>
		<p>And, since he could no longer use his sword, Wèi WúXiàn asked Lán SīZhuī to drive them back to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>Although not many people in Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù knew about Lán WàngJī’s condition, however, the matter was far to be trivial.</p>
		<p>Also, when they were back at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, the three teenagers, who didn’t know the details of what happened inside the cave, were even restless, while waiting outside Jingshi before being sent away.</p>
		<p>Right now, however, this unexpected turn of events caught Wèi WúXiàn and Lán XīChén off guard. Just a moment ago, they were worried while nursing the comatose Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>They didn’t expect him to suddenly wake up, let alone to behave like this; hugging his partner in front his uncle and brother, and refusing to let go of him.</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén frowned, as if he could not believe his eyes, and said, “How can he be in such a state just by the smell of wine?”</p>
		<p>“Uncle, although it sounds unbelievable, however, WàngJī’s case is an exception.” Lán XīChén commented, “It’s pity that WàngJī killed all the little monsters, and smashed all the jars that were filled with wine. Otherwise, we might have found some clues.”</p>
		<p>While stroking his goatee, Lán Qǐrén thought for a moment, then asked, “Have those people who were rescued regained consciousness?”</p>
		<p>“No, they’re still in state of stupor.” replied Lán XīChén, “Now right, our doctor is giving them medical treatment.”</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén nodded, and said, “In that case, when they recover their senses, listen to their accounts to see if you can learn more about this matter.”</p>
		<p>Then, he looked at Wèi WúXiàn who was hugged by his nephew. The scene was really awkward, no matter how you looked at it, and causing the veins of his temples to throb.</p>
		<p>He said, “Wèi Yīng, take WàngJī back to have some rest. And, for the time being, there is no need for him to give lessons.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn couldn’t agree more with what Lán Qǐrén just said, and hurriedly nodded his head.</p>
		<p>While turning to look at Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn was thinking that, once they returned to Jingshi, he would let Lán WàngJī do whatever he wanted, indulging him like a spoiled child.</p>
		<p>There would be no one around to watch them, and Lán WàngJī could take the advantage of being drunk to let himself go, doing what he wouldn’t normally dare to do.</p>
		<p>With difficulty, Wèi WúXiàn managed to free himself from Lán WàngJī’s grip around his waist, then, he smiled at him, and said, “Lán Zhàn, uncle said that we can go back to...”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn interrupted himself to listen to Lán WàngJī, who muttered, “Huh ... What ...?”</p>
		<p>However, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t hear every word that Lán WàngJī said.</p>
		<p>In the meantime, Lán Qǐrén felt suffocated just by watching them sitting so close together, and whispering to each other.</p>
		<p>And, when he was about to say something, Wèi WúXiàn asked in a coaxing voice, “Lán Zhàn, what did you said? Can you speak louder?”</p>
	</div>

		<br />
		<p>Lán Qǐrén couldn’t take it any longer, and uttered, “It is forbidden to make noise at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù and... ”</p>
		<p>Before he could finish reciting the rule, he heard Lán WàngJī saying, “Dizzy.” His voice was low and hoarse.</p>
		<p>Paying no heed to Lán Qǐrén’s reminder, Wèi WúXiàn tenderly cupped Lán WàngJī’s cheeks, and exclaimed, “You are feeling dizzy! How could that be? You had been sleeping for four hours.”</p>
		<p>Then, still holding Lán WàngJī’s face, Wèi WúXiàn leaned his head towards him so that his forehead could be in contact with Lán WàngJī’s forehead, then, he maintained this posture for a short while before saying, “You don’t have a fever.”</p>
		<p>Like an overprotective parent, Wèi WúXiàn carried on, “Lán Zhàn, do you feel pain anywhere else?”</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī didn’t reply directly. He first looked into Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes, then put his forehead against his, just like Wèi WúXiàn did before, and then, in a low voice, he replied, “Headache.”</p>
		<p>Without realising what he was doing, Wèi WúXiàn began gently to rub his forehead against Lán WàngJī’s forehead, while saying, “Then, let’s go back to Jingshi, so that you can lie down for a while.”</p>
		<p>He then adjusted Lán WàngJī’s collar, smoothed a wrinkle from it, and added, “Or, how about eating first before resting? You haven’t eaten anything yet.”</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén felt that if these two were still here, flirting shamelessly in front of him, he would have a headache, as well.</p>
		<p>And, as he was about to send them away, he saw Lán WàngJī imitating Wèi WúXiàn by brushing his forehead against his. Then, he heard him saying, “Come with me.”</p>
		<p>“Of course, I’ll go with you. I can’t let you go and rest by yourself.” Wèi WúXiàn reassured him.</p>
		<p>“Let’s eat together.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>“All right.” agreed Wèi WúXiàn, then, he added, “Èr-gēge*, I’m starving, let’s hurry up.”</p>
		<small>*Èr-gēge means second brother (every second son of a family can be called like that).</small>
		<p>Lán XīChén looked at them with amusement, then, with a smile, he said, “WúXiàn, and WàngJī, you guys must be tired from your Night Hunting. You should go back and get some rest. If we find out any new detail about this matter, uncle and I will let you know.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly said, “Thank you, Dà-gē. I’ll leave it you.”</p>
		<p>After they both stood up, Wèi WúXiàn tugged at Lán WàngJī’s sleeve to signal him that, it was time for them to leave.</p>
		<p>At that instant, Lán WàngJī seemed to act as usual. He bowed while saying, “Xiōng-zhǎng*, thank you so much for your trouble.”</p>
		<small>*Xiōng-zhǎng means elder brother (it’s more formal than Dà-gē).</small>
		<p>Seeing that Lán Qǐrén’s face became gloomy, Wèi WúXiàn suppressed a chuckle, and secretly stuck his tongue out at him, then, he said inwardly, “Sorry, Lán Lǎo, I didn’t mean to upset you.”</p>
		<p>Then, he thought to himself, “I should now be more careful not to add fuel to the fire, otherwise, Lán Zhàn will be punished by copying the GūsūLán rules when he becomes sober.”</p>
		<p>“Also,” he carried on, “if Lán Zhàn learned that he had behaved like a spoiled child in front of his uncle and brother, he would die with embarrassment.”</p>
		<p>Picturing Lán WàngJī overly embarrassed, Wèi WúXiàn held back from laughing aloud, as much as he could.</p>
		<p>When he was about to take him away, Wèi WúXiàn paused as he saw Lán WàngJī leaning towards him. Then, he suddenly realised what Lán WàngJī intended to do, but it was too later.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī had put one arm around Wèi WúXiàn’s back, and the other behind Wèi WúXiàn’s knees, then, lifting him and holding him in his arms, he walked towards the door.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn was horrified, he didn’t even dare to cast a glance at Lán Qǐrén. Then, before Lán WàngJī could reach the door, Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly said, “Lán Zhàn, put me down. There are many disciples out there.”</p>
		<p>As a result of what Wèi WúXiàn just said, Lán WàngJī suddenly stopped walking and stood still. It seemed as if he was thinking whether it matted or not.</p>
		<p>Seeing that, Wèi WúXiàn thought that he could coax him, however, before he could say something, Lán WàngJī began to let go of him in the way that Wèi WúXiàn would fall directly on the floor.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn was startled, and, instinctively, he hugged Lán WàngJī around the neck.</p>
		<p>This scene left uncle and brother speechless.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī seemed fully satisfied with this outcome; his beloved one had no more arguments to put forward, and obediently let him hold him in his arms.</p>
		<p>With his white clothes moving gracefully, Lán WàngJī walked out of his uncle’s sitting room.</p>
		<p>While watching his young brother leaving with Wèi WúXiàn in his arms, Lán XīChén thought, “WàngJī  can also behave like a spoiled child. It’s a good thing that he is less strict in front of the one he loves.”</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén was wondering if they had forgotten that he was still in the room.</p>
		<p>The disciple who was standing outside the sitting room tried to look as normal as possible, as he saw them walked past him.</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī who usually didn’t show signs of fatigue, this time, however, felt exhausted after eating and bathing. As for Lán JǐngYí, he quickly fell asleep.</p>
		<p>For more than half a month, they had been busy doing Night Hunting under the supervision of Wèi WúXiàn, acquiring a lot of knowledge and experience along the way. And Lán JǐngYí didn’t feel tired at the beginning.</p>
		<p>During their Night Hunting, Wèi WúXiàn never acted like a senior. He was always in a playful mood, narrating stories in the funniest way, and making them laugh all the time. He also said witty remarks that got them excited to show their skills.</p>
		<p>Three days prior to their return home, they heard that people from Lánlíng and Yúnmèng territories went missing, while others seemed either to be in a confused state, or not to remember what happened to them.</p>
		<p>The incidents occurred in various locations across the territory, which attracted attention of many sects of the cultivation world.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī also heard about the incidents. And, since Wèi WúXiàn and himself had already agreed to meet three days before their return, he went down to join them.</p>
		<p>With Lán WàngJī being there for supervising as well, Wèi WúXiàn was as lively as ever, while, nervous, the teenagers followed the rules.</p>
		<p>After a lengthy investigation, they had finally located the whereabouts of the monster.</p>
		<p>At that time, Lán SīZhuī thought that they would quickly solve the problem caused by that monster, then go back home. However, no one was expecting that turn of events.</p>
		<p>The scene where Wèi WúXiàn came out of the cave with Lán WàngJī on his back replayed in Lán SīZhuī’s head. Wèi WúXiàn seemed to be calm while instructing Jīn Líng and Lán JǐngYí.</p>
		<p>However, Lán SīZhuī noticed a profound sadness in Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes when he said to him, “Sorry, SīZhuī , I’ll trouble you to give us a ride back home on your sword.”</p>
		<p>Pulling himself together, Lán SīZhuī gathered his spiritual power to make his sword hover close to the ground, then, when they stepped on it, the sword flew at high altitude.</p>
		<p>Using his spiritual power in fully, Lán SīZhuī drove his sword as fast as he could. This was the first time he ever flew at such high speed. The blue light produced by his sword was like lightning crossing the sky.</p>
		<p>Even though Wèi WúXiàn didn’t urge him to speed up, Lán SīZhuī was only thinking of driving faster and faster.</p>
		<p>Throughout the whole journey back home, Wèi WúXiàn remained silent.</p>
		<p>As he drove them back, Lán SīZhuī said inwardly, “Both of them must have at one point suffered more than I could imagine. It must have been tough for them to attain a happy life they have now. So, I won’t let any misfortune happen to them again.”</p>
		<p>Even now, in the quiet of his room, when recalling the anxiety he read on Wèi WúXiàn’s face at that time, Lán SīZhuī felt his heart still ached.</p>
		<p>A groan of pain interrupted his thought. It was Lán JǐngYí who was moaning in his sleep. Lán SīZhuī walked to his bed and noticed that he was having a bad dream.</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí was gritting his teeth, his face had turned pale, and his forehead was covered with beads of sweat. The grimace of his face was similar to when he was dragged out of the monster’s lair.</p>
		<p>“Could it be that JǐngYí had seen something inside the cave back then, but didn’t have any recollection of it?” thought Lán SīZhuī.</p>
		<p>He hurried to wake him up from his nightmare, “JǐngYí? Wake up!”</p>
		<p>After calling him, shaking him, and even slapping him on the face a few times, Lán SīZhuī failed to wake him up. Without further delay, he reached for his guqin and began to play Melody of Lucidity.</p>
		<p>After a short while, Lán SīZhuī began to see changes in Lán JǐngYí’s condition; he had stopped groaning, and, gradually, his face expression became calm and relaxed.</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī was about to heave a sigh of relief when, suddenly, he detected a smell of alcohol in the room. Lán SīZhuī was shocked because it was the same smell that was coming out of that monster’s lair. He quickly played a sharp tune to ward off whatever it was.</p>
		<p>As a result, Lán JǐngYí’s body shook, then the smell of wine rapidly dissipated. Lán SīZhuī seemed to think of something, then, he got close to check on Lán JǐngYí, and noted that he was fine.</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī was finally relieved, then thought again, and came to a conclusion that the smell of wine was acting like an evil spirit, sneaking into someone’s body to disturb their mind.</p>
		<p>“But why Jīn Líng and Wèi-qiánbèi were not affected at all?” Lán SīZhuī pondered, “Not only they entered the cave, but also stayed there long enough.”</p>
		<p>He then put away his guqin, and was no longer feeling sleepy after all this. He felt the need of discussing this matter with someone, and, since Lán JǐngYí was still asleep, he thought he could go and see if Jīn Líng was awake.</p>
		<p>At that precise moment, he heard a loud ‘bang’ sound, and the door was flung open.</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí was woken by that blaring noise, almost jumped up from his bed.</p>
		<p>With a look of stupefaction on his face, Lán SīZhuī looked in the direction of the door, and saw Jīn Líng standing in the doorway, noting that he was undeniably very annoyed.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng thundered, “What the hell is going on here? Can you guys not let your guest sleep quietly? Is it not forbidden to make noise at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, according to your GūsūLán rules?”</p>
		<p>After taking a bath, Jīn Líng was about to go to bed when he received a letter from Jiāng Chéng, his uncle. As soon as he finished reading the letter, Jīn Líng’s mind began to race, then, after a while, he seemed to have understood something.</p>
		<p>Since he had been thinking for quite a while, as a result, Jīn Líng was having a hard time to find sleep.</p>
		<p>Then, suddenly, he heard someone shouting, followed by a gentle tune, and then, there was a piercing sound, and Jīn Líng had had enough.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng’s eyes scanned the room, and he saw Lán JǐngYí with a drowsy face lying in bed, which caused him to become even more upset, he uttered, “Lán JǐngYí, are you a dormouse? You still fall asleep after being unconscious for so long.”</p>
		<p>He then added, “Since I’m here, why don’t you get out of bed already?” Then, the very next instant, a quarrel between them broke out.</p>
		<p>After squabbling over what Jīn Líng said to him, and how he caused him to wake up, the two of them finally calmed down, and sat at the table along with Lán SīZhuī. Then, Jīn Líng told them about the letter he received.</p>
		<p>“Jīn zōng-zhǔ*, according to what you just said, Jiāng zōng-zhǔ sent you an update on the events that happened a few days ago.” Lán SīZhuī remarked, “In other words, there is some change in those who were affected by that monster’s wine.”</p>
		<small>*zōng-zhǔ is an honorific title for a sect leader.</small>
		<p>Jīn Líng affirmed, “That’s right. It seems that three of those common people from Yúnmèng territory have recovered from their state of stupor.”</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí were baffled.</p>
		<p>Then, Lán JǐngYí asked, “How did they regain consciousness? No one in YúnmèngJiāng sect knows how to play Melody of Lucidity.”</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī remarked, “Although I use my guqin to make people sober, it is in fact very difficult to achieve. I wonder what kind of method Jiāng zōng-zhǔ used to make them regain consciousness.”</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng pulled off a small round bell from his waist belt, and replied, “By using this.” while showing them the spherical bell.</p>
		<p>He carried, “This Qīngxīn-líng is used by YúnmèngJiāng sect, and has the effect of calming people’s mind. Moreover, Wèi WúXiàn added into it a very powerful talisman that repels evil spirits.</p>
		<p>“Those, who have regained consciousness, don’t usually drink alcohol, and if they do, they only consume a small amount of it. Therefore, they were not greatly affected, which, in turn, made them recover much faster than others.</p>
		<p>“My uncle noticed that soon after using Qīngxīn-líng on them, the smell of wine, which was emanated from them, will suddenly vanish.”</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī thought, then exclaimed, “That’s right!” He seemed to talk to himself rather than to others.</p>
		<p>Noticing that two pairs of eyes were fixed on him, Lán SīZhuī said, “You both know that Wèi-qiánbèi put talismans on each of us except on HánGuāng-Jūn, back then. I think he didn’t plan on letting him get inside the cave.</p>
		<p>“So, that will explain why HánGuāng-Jūn’s condition seems to be more serious than JǐngYí ’s, even though JǐngYí stayed inside much longer than HánGuāng-Jūn.”</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí pondered, then said, “SīZhuī, with the high level of HánGuāng-Jūn’s cultivation, do you really think he also needed Wèi-qiánbèi to put a talisman on him?</p>
		<p>“Besides, HánGuāng-Jūn stayed there only for a short period of time, and also eliminated all those monsters. As a result, when Jīn Líng and I went inside to get those people out of the cave, there was no more smell of wine in there.”</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng commented, “No matter how powerful HánGuāng-Jūn is, he is still a human being. Also, unlike both of you who sometimes drink alcohol, his alcohol tolerance is worst than yours.</p>
		<p>“Moreover, didn’t you see those broken jars? This means that the smell of wine must have been much stronger at that time. So, even though HánGuāng-Jūn didn’t stay there longer, it was enough for him to be affected by the smell.</p>
		<p>“Besides, the first time you went in, you didn’t go deeper into the cave, you fainted close to the entrance. So, it’s normal that your case was not serious.”</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī thought, then said, “This matter is not that simple.”</p>
		<p>“SīZhuī, what do you mean by that?” Lán JǐngYí asked, “Have you figured out something else?”</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī replied, “I think that the smell of that monster’s wine is like a resentment. It can evoke someone’s dreadful memories, making people relive those memories, which can be worse than a nightmare.”</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí was extremely shocked. In dismay, he said, “But Wèi-qiánbèi and Zéwú-Jūn said that HánGuāng-Jūn will be fine.”</p>

		<br />
		<p>Jīn Líng said, “My uncle also said that among those three cases, there was a woman who, as soon as she has regained consciousness, was asking after her child.</p>
		<p>“People close to her said that when she was in confused state, she kept saying: ‘My child is dead’, but her child is safe and sound.</p>
		<p>“It turns out that, in the past, she had lost a child. If we follow your reasoning, it will mean that the woman must have been dreaming about the past events.”</p>
		<p>“It’s probably true.” said Lán SīZhuī, “Earlier, when JǐngYí had a bad dream, I recognised the terrified expression on his face; it was the same expression he had when he was frightened by a fierce corpse, which was hanging upside down from the ceiling.</p>
		<p>“JǐngYí, do you remember that time?”</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí remained silent as if he was lost in thought.</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī carried on, “Since I couldn’t wake you up, I played Melody of Lucidity. Then, when you got better, there was suddenly a smell of wine in the room. It felt like resentful energy. So, I played an aggressive tune, and the smell vanished.”</p>
		<p>“Is that so?” said Lán JǐngYí, “So many things happened while I was sleeping. Did HánGuāng-Jūn also see some terrifying event before losing consciousness?”</p>
		<p>Suddenly, the room fell into dead silence, following Lán JǐngYí’s question. Although it sounded improbable, however, Lán SīZhuī and Jīn Líng knew that it was most likely to be the case.</p>
		<p>Seeing the other two remained silent, Lán JǐngYí scratched his head, wondering if he had said something wrong.</p>
		<p>He carried on, “I can hardly imagine HánGuāng-Jūn being afraid of something.”</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng frowned. He didn’t know what to say, and kept quiet.</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī wanted to say something but he hesitated. He then dropped his gaze and said inwardly, “It’s not hard to imagine what HánGuāng-Jūn is afraid of.</p>
		<p>“Throughout those thirteen years, after giving lessons, he would go Night Hunting. And, late at night, after he finished correcting assignments, he would stay quietly in his room, plucking at the strings of his guqin.</p>
		<p>“When watching him, even all you could see was his back, you still could feel his loneliness.</p>
		<p>“So, whatever HánGuāng-Jūn had seen while he was in the cave must be related to the same fear back then.</p>
		<p>“However, this time, I am sure that HánGuāng-Jūn will be fine, because Wèi-qiánbèi is by his side.”</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>For the first in his life, Wèi WúXiàn truly appreciated the existence of the three thousands rules of GūsūLán, especially the two that forbade their people: to talk behind someone’s back and to make noises, which helped him cope with the overwhelming embarrassment that he felt at this moment.</p>
		<p>Running into two young disciples on their way back to Jingshi, Wèi WúXiàn hid his face that had already turned red, as he saw that they were shocked but didn’t dare to speak, only bowed their heads, and quickly moved away.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn tried  as much as he could to attract less attention to himself, however, in the pale background of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, his iconic black clothes was an eye-catching, let alone being in Lán WàngJī’s arms.</p>
		<p>Inwardly, he said, “Young boys, it’s not that I want to corrupt your innocence or chastity. It’s just that I can’t handle Lán Zhàn when he is drunk. He is too strong for me, and once he set up his mind to do something, he won’t give in, no matter what.”</p>
		<p>And, when he struggled to free himself from his arms, Lán WàngJī held him even more tight, and looked at him with fondness. In his eyes, Wèi WúXiàn also read a hint of sadness, that he could not bear, and eventually chose to indulge him.</p>
		<p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn begged him to walk much faster, so that they could quickly reach their dwelling. However, much to his surprise, Lán WàngJī did just the opposite; slowing down his pace, and taking all his time.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, Lán WàngJī seemed to have made a long detour, passing by the locations where there were usually many people, such as the front of Orchid Room*.</p>
		<small>*Orchid Room is the name of GūsūLán classroom.</small>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn put a hand on his forehead, and, inwardly, said to himself, “Oh my! How did it slip my mind that when Lán Zhàn is drunk, he turns a deaf ear to everything that he doesn’t want to hear?”</p>
		<p>Fortunately, there was no lecture today, and most of the disciples, included those from other sects who came to study at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, were in the library. Only a few youngsters were outside, walking around.</p>
		<p>The only two things that Wèi WúXiàn could do were submissively letting Lán WàngJī carry him, and patiently waiting for them to reach Jingshi.</p>
		<p>With a dignified expression on his face, Lán WàngJī walked slowly on the paved paths of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù. And, occasionally, when Wèi WúXiàn stirred in his arms, he would stopped walking, looked at him with tenderness, then resumed walking.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn had leaned his head against Lán WàngJī’s shoulder, and the gentle fragrance of sandalwood emanated from Lán WàngJī wrapped around him.</p>
		<p>He started to look at Lán WàngJī’s white and graceful neck, then up to the smooth curve of his jaws, and then, his eyes lingered at Lán WàngJī’s profile, while thinking that he would never get tired of looking at his face.</p>
		<p>Then, as some Lán WàngJī’s long hair had slipped in front, Wèi WúXiàn began to twist it with his fingers.</p>
		<p>As he carried on fiddling with Lán WàngJī’s hair, Wèi WúXiàn replayed Lán WàngJī’s behaviour in his mind; each time they met some disciples on their way; he would stop and wait for them to bow, and walk away with a surprising expression on their faces.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn’s lips curved into a smile while rerunning those scenes in his head.</p>
		<p>His facial expression seemed to reflect a feeling of satisfaction. The more Wèi WúXiàn thought about Lán WàngJī’s behaviour, the cuter he looked.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī noticed the warm smile of Wèi WúXiàn. He stopped, looked at him, and smiled as well. This time, there was no trace of sadness in his crystal-like eyes,</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn blinked, because he wasn’t sure if Lán WàngJī was still drunk. So, he held up two fingers in front of Lán WàngJī, and asked, “Èr-gēge, how many fingers?”</p>
		<p>The first thing that crossed Lán WàngJī’s mind was to grab Wèi WúXiàn’s fingers with his both hands. However, he realised that if he did so, it would require him to let go of Wèi WúXiàn, which he definitely didn’t want to do. So, he replied, “Two.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn read him like an open book, and suppressed a chuckle, he then said, “Well done! Here, I’ll give you a reward.”</p>
		<p>In a coquettish manner, Wèi WúXiàn wrapped his arms around Lán WàngJī’s neck, and kissed him on the cheek.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī’s heart skipped a beat, his eyes widened, his ears turned red, and his Adam’s apple bobbed up and down.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn amusingly said inwardly, “As time goes by, it’s getting harder to see this reaction when I tease Lán Èr-gōngzǐ*. But now that he is drunk not only he becomes frank and stubborn, but also he has this innocent expression of a teenager. This is quite interesting.”</p>
		<small>*gōngzǐ is an honorific title for a son of a noble family.</small>
		<p>Very excited, Wèi WúXiàn, in a teasing way, asked, “Why, all of a sudden, do you become so timid?” Then, since Lán WàngJī didn’t react, he said, “If that is so, then put me down.”</p>
		<p>At the moment he heard Wèi WúXiàn’s last words, Lán WàngJī pulled himself together, held him even more tight, and loudly said, “I won’t.”</p>
		<p>Then, he seemed to remember that it was not allowed to raise one’s voice, which caused him to be embarrassed. And, as a result, he began to walk much faster.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn was delighted by that result, then, he said, “Not bad at all. Hurry up, or else...”</p>
		<p>Instead of completing his sentence, Wèi WúXiàn moved his head close to his, then kissed Lán WàngJī’s earlobe.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī almost stumbled, he stopped to establish his balance, then resumed walking. His pace was as fast as the wind, causing his white clothes to flutter.</p>
		<p>Then, he heard Wèi WúXiàn whispering to his ear, “If you don’t hurry up, I’ll keep kissing you until we reach Jingshi.”</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>Some disciples who were coming out of the library saw, like a comet crossing the sky, a bright light produced by the silver sword, heading towards Jingshi, and was accompanied by a melodious laughter, which was very heartwarming.</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>Lán WàngJī’s heart was beating very fast, and despite the layers of his high quality clothes, the throb of his heartbeat could not be concealed, and were easy sensed by Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>Looking at Lán WàngJī who was desperately rushing towards their room at a high speed, because he was aroused by him, Wèi WúXiàn smile froze, thinking that he might have gone too far this time. But there was no other way.</p>
		<p>On top of that, every time when he saw Lán WàngJī who was usually calm and well-mannered losing control of himself because of him, Wèi WúXiàn could not help but keep teasing him.</p>
		<p>And, each time it happened, Wèi WúXiàn was like seized by a feeling of a great accomplishment, he said inwardly, “Lán Zhàn’s current state of arousal is caused by me.”</p>
		<p>After saying that to himself, all traces of guilt were swept away from his face. He even licked his lips with excitement.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī seemed to have reached his limit. As soon as he landed, he grabbed his sword, then, on second thought, he threw the top-grade spiritual sword on the ground without ceremony, thinking that it was too much of a hindrance.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes widened in surprise. Then, he pretended to be shocked, and said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, don’t you want Bìchén* any longer? Why are you in such a rush?”</p>
		<small>*Bìchén is the name of Lán WàngJī’s sword.</small>
		<p>Without paying attention to what Wèi WúXiàn was saying, Lán WàngJī stormed into the room, and carried him straight to the bedroom. Immediately after he laid Wèi WúXiàn on the bed, Lán WàngJī also got on the bed with his body pressed down on Wèi WúXiàn’s body.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī was breathing heavily, while trying to control his sexual urge. Meanwhile, Wèi WúXiàn was getting turned on by Lán WàngJī’s warm breath brushing the soft skin of his neck.</p>
		<p>He put his hands on Lán WàngJī’s back, and began gentle to run his fingers. Now that he was no longer worried about Lán WàngJī’s condition, Wèi WúXiàn wanted to be held tight.</p>
		<p>Even if Lán WàngJī held him too tight to the point of feeling pain, it was preferable than to see him lying unconscious in the bed.</p>
		<p>Inhaling the usual fragrance of sandalwood, Wèi WúXiàn let out a long sigh of relief, then, he whispered on Lán WàngJī’s ear, “Lán Zhàn, next time, don’t do this so suddenly, I...”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn interrupted himself as he saw Lán WàngJī raising his head to look at him. He noted that Lán WàngJī’s ears were still red, however, he was no longer in a hurry to hold him like he usually did.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī’s golden eyes were fixed at Wèi WúXiàn intensely, as though he wanted to know if it was okay for him to carry on holding him.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn’s feeling of uneasiness came back to his mind. He had a gut feeling that something was not quite right with Lán WàngJī. He looked at him with a puzzled expression in his face, then, he called out, “Lán Zhàn?”</p>
		<p>At that instant, Lán WàngJī began to stroke Wèi WúXiàn hair, then brush one of his eyebrows, he carried on caressing Wèi WúXiàn’s cheek, and then, his slender fingers touched Wèi WúXiàn’s slightly parted, sensual lips.</p>
		<p>At the moment he run his fingers on Wèi WúXiàn’s lips, Lán WàngJī suddenly stopped, and the rhythm of his breathing became chaotic.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn was now certain that something was definitely wrong with Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>Usually, he would kiss and hold him without hesitation. After all, they were a couple, and had an intimate relationship.</p>
		<p>It was not like at the beginning of their relationship when, sometimes, Lán WàngJī would show some hesitation or shyness in touching Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, when Lán WàngJī was drunk, he wouldn’t hesitate even for an instant to kiss Wèi WúXiàn earnestly. Dominant, he wouldn’t let Wèi WúXiàn escape from his hold.</p>
		<p>So, why did he, even being drunk, become hesitant?</p>
		<p>“Wait a minute!” Wèi WúXiàn seemed to think hard, “The way Lán Zhàn hugged me inside the cave, and the look on his face when he stared at me were strange. And, earlier, when he held me in the sitting room of Lán Lǎo, could it be that...”</p>
		<p>Putting his both hands against Lán WàngJī’s chest, Wèi WúXiàn began, “Lán Zhàn, are you...”</p>
		<p>Without warning, Lán WàngJī interrupted Wèi WúXiàn with a sudden kiss. And the latter could easily feel that Lán WàngJī was trembling uncontrollably.</p>
		<p>Then, as if he was afraid that Wèi WúXiàn would resist him, Lán WàngJī firmly wrapped his arm around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist, while his other hand held the back of Wèi WúXiàn’s head.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī’s kisses were first gentle, then quickly became more intense, showing his fierce desire. He kissed Wèi WúXiàn with passion and fury, and, like always, making him unable to resist his caress.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn didn’t expect to be kissed so suddenly, and in the way Lán WàngJī usually kissed him.</p>
		<p>However, he held him more tight than usual that Wèi WúXiàn could barely move. He managed to free his arms, and wrapped them around Lán WàngJī’s shoulders.</p>
		<p>But Lán WàngJī misunderstood his gesture, thinking that Wèi WúXiàn was trying to resist him, and pressed down on Wèi WúXiàn’s body even more.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn found it difficult to breath under Lán WàngJī’s strong embrace. He let out weak sound of pain, however, since his mouth was covered by Lán WàngJī’s kisses, it sounded like a lustful moan.</p>
		<p>As a result, Lán WàngJī became even more enticed by the moan, sucking Wèi WúXiàn’s tongue, twisting his own tongue around his fiercely.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī’s tongue was hot and insatiable, sweeping each inch of Wèi WúXiàn’s mouth in a voracious way. Their both lips kept on intertwining, while their heads tossing and turning continuously.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn found it harder and harder to breathe properly. Being out of breath, Wèi WúXiàn’s chest was moving up and down rapidly. His grip around Lán WàngJī’s shoulders loosed, and his arms began slowly to slide down.</p>
		<p>Lack of sleep and adequate breathing caused Wèi WúXiàn to suddenly feel dizzy, and his whole body gradually became weak.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī noticed the change on Wèi WúXiàn, and withdrew his tongue from his mouth. Then, he began gently to lick Wèi WúXiàn’s lips to let him catch his breath.</p>
		<p>As was his habit, Lán WàngJī bit Wèi WúXiàn’s lower lip, which was slightly swollen by his intense kisses. Then, he raised his head to look at Wèi WúXiàn who became so horny that his facial expression caused sexual arousal.</p>

		<br />
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn slowly opened his eyes. On the pillow, his long and thick black hair looked like a waterfall. It was further adorned with his red hairband. His fair and handsome face was slightly tinted with red colour.</p>
		<p>With his black eyes sparkling like a surface of a pond in the moonlight, and his lips curved into a smile, the lips that had been devoured by the kisses to the point of turning scarlet and tempting, Wèi WúXiàn looked fully satisfied after being intensively loved by Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>Now that his overly sexual desire had been quenched, Lán WàngJī held Wèi WúXiàn in his arms, tenderly brushed aside some hair that had fallen on Wèi WúXiàn’s forehead, and adjusted the collar of Wèi WúXiàn’s top garment.</p>
		<p>Having his breathing gradually returning to a normal pace, Wèi WúXiàn leaned his head against Lán WàngJī’s chest, while trying to figure out Lán WàngJī’s out-of-character reactions.</p>
		<p>The two of them remained silent for a while.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, Wèi WúXiàn was recalling what happened from the moment Lán WàngJī joined him in the cave until now. Then, he came to the conclusion that something was off with Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>He then looked at him with a serious expression on his face, and asked, “Lán Zhàn, who am I?”</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī’s eyes widened in surprise, then, he replied, “I know that you are Wèi Yīng.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn shook his head, and said, “This is not what I mean.”</p>
		<p>As he spoke, he raised his upper body, held Lán WàngJī’s face, then, he asked again, “Look around the room carefully, then, tell me, who am I to you?”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn’s question puzzled Lán WàngJī. Nevertheless, he scanned the room that was very familiar to him, then, soon after, he noticed that both the wardrobe and the bookshelf were more larger than usual.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī looked perplexed for a moment, then, he seemed to recall something, and quickly looked at Wèi WúXiàn, he began, “You and I ...”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn gave him an encouraging smile.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī closed his eyes, and began to search his memory, then, suddenly, he reopened his eyes, his face at this time wore his usual expression.</p>
		<p>He resumed, “After our three kowtows, you and I have been living as a couple.”</p>
		<p>“That’s right.” said Wèi WúXiàn with a bright smile on his face.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī carried on, “And, it’s been more that three years that what we feel for each other is mutual.”</p>
		<p>“Indeed.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī went on, “Uncle has even included us on the family record book as a couple.”</p>
		<p>“That’s true!” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>He then hugged Lán WàngJī, and added, “In other words, I’ve been yours for a long time, and it is known by everyone.”</p>
		<p>“Yes.” said Lán WàngJī, then, he kissed Wèi WúXiàn on the forehead, and held him tight in his arms.</p>
		<p>At last, Wèi WúXiàn felt relieved, and let out a long sigh, he said, “Finally, you have recovered your memories.”</p>
		<p>“Sorry.” Lán WàngJī said, “A lot of memories flashed into my head so suddenly.” He seemed as though he was still a little bit confused.</p>
		<p>He then buried his face in Wèi WúXiàn’s neck, and, in a sad tone, he carried on, “I remember everything, however, I couldn’t recall them straight away.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn gently patted his shoulder. He found this situation was a little bit distressing as well as funny.</p>
		<p>By observing Lán WàngJī’s gloomy expression, Wèi WúXiàn concluded that his memories were not the main issue here. “Is he still drunk?” Wèi WúXiàn pondered.</p>
		<p>As a caring partner, Wèi WúXiàn couldn’t bear to see his beloved husband feeling depressed, and blaming himself for being disoriented.</p>
		<p>He comforted him by saying, “JǐngYí also fainted when he got inside the cave. But he couldn’t even tell what happened to him. Also, that monster’s wine had the effect of evoking people’s bad memories, and made them feel confused.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn carried on, “However, my HánGuāng-Jūn is so amazing. You have quickly recovered your memories.”</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī remained silent. He never thought of himself as a reckless person who would fall into a trap so easily, and feeling that he didn’t deserve to be praised.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn became helpless, because the lack of reaction from Lán WàngJī was unusual, especially when he was drunk. “Why does it bother him so much?” he thought.</p>
		<p>“Come on, Èr-gēge! Don’t blame yourself so much. Just tell me what did you see inside the cave. It’s not good to keep suppressing your emotions.” Wèi WúXiàn cheered him up.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī then raised his head and looked at Wèi WúXiàn, his lips were not only pressed together tightly, but also were trembling slightly, his eyes were filled with regret.</p>
		<p>After a while, he began, “Nightless Sky City* ...” after a shot pause, he resumed, “I left you by yourself ...” then, he didn’t carry on at this point, because it was clear, for both of them, what memories he had seen.</p>
		<small>*Nightless Sky City is where Wèi WúXiàn fought alone against thousands of cultivators. When he lost control of himself, Lán WàngJī took him away.</small>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn fell silent. He would have said to him not to take it to heart, if what he saw were some illusory memories, however, they were real memories.</p>
		<p>Those dreadful memories were hard to forget. It was heartbreaking even though you just looked into one of them.</p>
		<p>Both of them were doing their best to live a happy life together as much as possible, so that, one day, they could look at their devastated past with ease.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn had died once, but brought back through a body sacrifice ritual. He was given a second chance, after so many years since his death, so he should live his life in fully.</p>
		<p>Even though his physical appearance was not his own, he should start a new life, and forget the painful experience of being besieged by thousands of cultivators, as well as the unbearable torture of being devoured by countless demons.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn couldn’t help but begin to reminisce each event that occurred just after he came back to life.</p>
		<p>The first things he recognised was the uniforms of the GūsūLán sect. When he saw those teenagers from GūsūLán, it brought back memories when he was attending classes at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.</p>
		<p>Then, he commented on those inexperienced juniors, thinking that Lán WàngJī was already powerful when he was their age.</p>
		<p>And, when he met Jīn Líng, at that time he didn’t know his identity, and thought that the boy had a disrespectful attitude towards people.</p>
		<p>Soon after, he saw Wēn Níng who became like a zombie, and Jiāng Chéng who still bore a grudge towards him after so many years.</p>
		<p>Then, when Lán WàngJī grabbed his hand, he sighed inward. He knew at once that he could no longer escape, even though his intention was to live an ordinary and peaceful life, in some place where no one knew him.</p>
		<p>From then, they started Night Hunting together for several months, and slowly unravelling the secrets of the past events.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn then carried on recalling the events that happened prior his death. Thinking that, although he had cut off his Golden Core, he was still unable to assist Jiāng Chéng to strengthen YúnmèngJiāng sect.</p>
		<p>He had promised his Shījiě* that he would give her a grand wedding, but he couldn’t fulfil his promise. And, in the end, she died along with Jīn ZiXuān, her husband.</p>
		<small>*Shījiě means senior sister. Wèi WúXiàn refers to Jiāng YànLí, Jīn Líng’s mother.</small>
		<p>He was the one who chose the name for his Shījiě’s child, however, he was no longer there to protect Jīn Líng when was a kid.</p>
		<p>He had saved Wēn Qíng and her relatives, but he still failed to keep them safe.</p>
		<p>He had tried hard to convince Lán WàngJī to visit Yúnmèng, but he never succeeded. Back then, he didn’t realise his own feeling towards Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>After learning how deep he was loved by him, Wèi WúXiàn could barely imagine how Lán WàngJī was filled with grief at his death, and kept on grieving all those years.</p>
		<p>“And now, he said with regret that he shouldn’t have let me by myself at that time.” Wèi WúXiàn said inwardly.</p>
		<p>“Back then, when I was thrown into the mass grave, what kind of state of mind had you been in?” Wèi WúXiàn pondered.</p>
		<p>“About what happened at Nightless Sky City, can you please not recall them at all? he carried on inwardly.</p>
		<p>“How painful was it, when you had received thirty three whips of punishment because of me?”</p>
		<p>“Those days when you were alone and continuously asking spirits my whereabouts, how tormenting was it for you?”</p>
		<p>“There were so many questions that I wanted to ask, however, they were all as sharp as a knife that I didn’t dare to ask for fear that they would open the old wounds.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn choked back the tears. He then lowered his head, his hair slid and hid his face. He didn’t want Lán WàngJī to see him looking sad.</p>
		<p>After a while, he raised his head and smiled as usual. Then, while undressing Lán WàngJī, he said, “Since you remember everything, let’s take a bath, then rest.”</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>At the mountain gate of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí saw off Jīn Líng.</p>
		<p>Although they got some news from Jiāng Chéng, they were still not sure whether their guess was exact. So, they decided to wait for those people they had rescued from that monster’s lair to recover.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, since those incidents had started in Lánlíng territory, Jiāng Chéng must have found out something, so, he asked Jīn Líng to go back.</p>
		<p>Even though Jīn Líng was a little bit reluctant to leave, he knew that he had to go, since the matter was serious.</p>
		<p>Lán JǐngYí noticed the dark circles under Jīn Líng’s eyes, and felt a little bit guilty, recalling that when he was having a nightmare, to help him, Lán SīZhuī played his guqin, which actually disturbed Jīn Líng from getting some rest.</p>
		<p>He said, “Is it really urgent that you have to leave now? You look so exhausted. What don’t you stay and rest for a while?”</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng rolled his eyes, and uttered, “There’s no need. Besides, with my uncle’s temperament, do you think he has patience to wait? I think that you two should deal with the issues you have right now.”</p>
		<p>Since they were still unaware that Lán WàngJī had already woken, Jīn Líng was referring to him, as well as those innocent people who were affected by the monster’s wine. Then, the three of them suddenly looked gloomy.</p>
		<p>They agreed that if there was any new occurrence on the matter, they would communicate to each other via Wèi WúXiàn’s transmitter talismans.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, Lán SīZhuī said, “Jīn zōng-zhǔ, please don’t let anyone know about HánGuāng-Jūn’s condition, since we don’t know exactly what happened to him.”</p>
		<p>That was because Lán WàngJī had a high status not only in GūsūLán sect, but also in the entire world of cultivation. It was better to be cautious, and avoid any unnecessary commotion.</p>
		<p>As a young leader who had gained insight into the cultivation world, Jīn Líng understood the meaning behind what Lán SīZhuī said, and nodded his head to show his cooperation.</p>
		<p>He then quietly recited his sword incantation, and Suìhuá emitted a golden light, unsheathed itself and suspended flat above the ground level.</p>
		<p>Putting his qiánkūn-dài* on his shoulder, Jīn Líng stepped on his sword, and flew across the sky like a feathered arrow that emitted a golden light.</p>
		<small>*qiánkūn-dài is a dimensionless bag that can contain anything.</small>
		<p>After watching Jīn Líng flying away until he disappeared from their sight, Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí turned around, and began to climb the stairs to return to their dwelling.</p>
		<p>As they did so, Lán SīZhuī fell into silence, and Lán JǐngYí knew that, despite his calm appearance, Lán SīZhuī was actually very concerned about Lán WàngJī’s condition.</p>
		<p>So, in order to liven up his mood, Lán JǐngYí said, “Look how Dà-XiǎoJiě* was so eager to go back. I think that Jiāng zōng-zhǔ has uncovered something about this matter.”</p>
		<small>*Dà-XiǎoJiě, in this particular case, means a girl with a bit of a bad temperament. Lán JǐngYí usually calls Jīn Líng like this.</small>
		<p>He carried on, “And, since some common people over there have recovered, I also believe that HánGuāng-Jūn will wake up soon. So, don’t worry, SīZhuī.”</p>
		<p>Upon listening to what Lán JǐngYí said to him,  Lán SīZhuī smiled.</p>
		<p>Although Lán JǐngYí was carefree and straightforward, Lán SīZhuī knew that, sometimes, he could make an observation and be thoughtful. After all, they grew up together, so he knew Lán JǐngYí’s character.</p>
		<p>He understood that Lán JǐngYí was trying to comfort him, and, in a gentle voice, he said, “I know. Thank you, JǐngYí. Besides, this time, Wèi-qiánbèi is here, so, HánGuāng-Jūn will be fine.”</p>
		<p>“That’s right!” exclaimed Lán JǐngYí, “I think that Wèi-qiánbèi is quite cool. And, in case the situation gets worse, Zéwú-Jūn is also here, as well as other elders.”</p>
		<p>Despite being able to read Lán SīZhuī’s mind, Lán JǐngYí, however, failed to grasp the real issue that could greatly affect Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>In spite of his feeling hopeless, Lán SīZhuī just nodded to him. Nevertheless, he felt more at ease now.</p>
		<p>Noting that Lán SīZhuī’s mood had been improved, Lán JǐngYí was satisfied, and didn’t say anything more. And, after assuring that no one was around to see him, he lazily stretched his body.</p>
		<p>He then began to think about their early conversation, and couldn’t help but ponder inwardly, “What can possibly frighten HánGuāng-Jūn?”</p>
		<p>He carried on. “Since the resentful energy that entered my body was expelled after I was frightened in my dream, what exactly does Wèi-qiánbèi need to do, in order to force the resentful energy out of HánGuāng-Jūn’s body?”</p>
		<br />

		<p>After being undressed by Wèi WúXiàn, Lán WàngJī’s wore a blank expression for a short while.</p>
		<p>Earlier, when Wèi WúXiàn was silent, even though he couldn’t see his face, Lán WàngJī felt that his mood was down.</p>
		<p>And, when Wèi WúXiàn raised his head and smiled at him, he noted a faint melancholy in Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes.</p>
		<p>Although he was overwhelmed by the strong smell of alcohol, which clouded his thinking, Lán WàngJī was able to regain the memories of their daily routine, and those memories were right now floating in his head like a dream.</p>
		<p>He let Wèi WúXiàn take him to the bathtub, his eyes followed Wèi WúXiàn’s every movement, watching him walking to the wardrobe and taking out their clothes to be worn after bath.</p>
		<p>He watched Wèi WúXiàn pulling open the panel screen painted with a landscape of mountains and rivers.</p>
		<p>As Wèi WúXiàn moved about, Lán WàngJī’s gaze also followed the graceful movement of his red hairband.</p>
		<p>“My mind is finally in peace.” Lán WàngJī said inwardly, “I can now relax my whole body, because this is not a dream, the person in front me has indeed become my partner.”</p>
		<p>He carried on, “He is no longer a spirit that I couldn’t contact, nor is he a yearning that I couldn’t obtain.”</p>

		<br />
		<p>After filled the bathtub, Wèi WúXiàn dipped his hand into the bathwater to check the temperature. Satisfied, he then rolled up the sleeves of his white robe, which revealed the smoothness of the skin of his arms.</p>
		<p>The robe was of a thin fabric that was slightly larger at the shoulders, and it was tied around his slender waist, making him look thin and delicate.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn looked at Lán WàngJī, and noted that the latter was feverishly watching every single part of his body, which made him feel a little bit hot.</p>
		<p>With a smile on his face, he said, “Èr-gēge, get into the bathtub, I’ll help you clean off the dust on your body.”</p>
		<p>However, Lán WàngJī spread his arms instead, letting Wèi WúXiàn know that he wanted him to remove the last inner robe, as well.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn was amused, and, of course, he was delighted to do whatever his beloved husband wanted him to do.</p>
		<p>While helping him remove his robe, Wèi WúXiàn said inwardly, “Lán Zhàn likes being clean all the time. After the incident that happened in the monster’s lair, we have been covered with dust.”</p>
		<p>“However,” he carried on, “since I was really concerned about his condition, it didn’t cross my mind to even change clothes, let alone taking a bath.”</p>
		<p>After Lán WàngJī got into the bathtub, Wèi WúXiàn brush back his long and silky hair, took a soft cloth, soaked it with the bathwater, and then, he began gently to wash the beautiful face of his hubby.</p>
		<p>In order to make Wèi WúXiàn’s task easier, Lán WàngJī raised his head while he kept his eyes closed.</p>
		<p>Since he was looking younger than his age, Lán WàngJī’s skin was white and smooth. This was due to the immortality cultivation that enabled cultivators to maintain their youthful appearance.</p>
		<p>Not only he looked younger, but also his arched eyebrows were perfectly shaped, his long eyelashes were beautifully curled, with some thin droplets of water were hanging on them, the eyelashes appeared to be even more gorgeous.</p>
		<p>When his eyes were opened, one could see that they were as clear and pure as a crystal ball, just like those of Wèi WúXiàn, unclouded by even a speck of dust.</p>
		<p>Maybe because the mood at that precise moment was so calm and pleasant, that his body was relaxed, and that his mind was at ease, that, all of a sudden, Wèi WúXiàn yearned to get as close as one could be to Lán WàngJī.</p>
		<p>Gazing at the face that was pleasing to eye, Wèi WúXiàn became a little bit aroused. Unaware of the cloth that had slipped from his hand, he began slowly to run his fingers on Lán WàngJī’s flawless face.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, as he was getting closer to Lán WàngJī, he put his left hand on the edge of the bathtub to support himself.</p>
		<p>As his face gradually approaching his, their breaths intertwined. Then, Wèi WúXiàn tenderly kissed Lán WàngJī on the forehead.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, there was a ripple in the bathwater, caused by Lán WàngJī’s heartbeat. He then opened his eyes.</p>
		<p>Looking into Lán WàngJī’s eyes, Wèi WúXiàn could read a burning desire, which caused his heart to beat faster.</p>
		<p>The steam from the bathwater was spreading around, dampening the thin fabric of Wèi WúXiàn's robe, which revealed his svelte body.</p>
		<p>The more Lán WàngJī stared at Wèi WúXiàn’s body through the wet clothe, the more horny he became, and his facial expression was announcing the coming storm.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn looked at Lán WàngJī in a coquettish way, parted his red lips, and murmured, “Èr-gēge, you’re really handsome.”</p>
		<p>This time, there was a wave that surged in the bathwater; Lán WàngJī’s heart was racing.</p>
		<p>Unable to bear it any longer, he suddenly pulled Wèi WúXiàn into the bathtub, and held him in his arms.</p>
		<p>His breathing had quickened, and, without losing any time, he buried his face on Wèi WúXiàn’s neck and began to suck it, leaving love bites here and there on the graceful neck.</p>
		<p>“If this is what you want, I’ll give you even more.” Wèi WúXiàn said inwardly.</p>
		<p>He then tilted his head back to expose a fair and slim neck, moved his slightly shaking legs forward, and wrapped them around Lán WàngJī’s waist, and then, he began rub his body against his.</p>
		<p>It was hard to tell whether he was teasing Lán WàngJī or begging for more.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī carried on sucking and biting on the slender neck, then kissed and traced the smooth area of Wèi WúXiàn’s collarbones fervently.</p>
		<p>He stroked Wèi WúXiàn’s body inch by inch, making him trembling uncontrollable under his touch that Wèi WúXiàn pressed his body even more tight against his.</p>
		<p>Staring dreamily at the ceiling that was covered with steam, Wèi WúXiàn moaned, as Lán WàngJī kept on caressing him.</p>
		<p>Under bathwater, with Lán WàngJī’s hands fondling him and making him feel so good, Wèi WúXiàn could not distinguish the right hand from the left one.</p>
		<p>It was as though he had turned into a musical instrument in Lán WàngJī’s arms, and not a single inch was left untouched.</p>
		<p>As Lán WàngJī ran his fingers on his back, Wèi WúXiàn sensed the slightly hardened skin on Lán WàngJī’s fingertips.</p>
		<p>He then uttered inwardly, “This should be his right hand. He uses these fingers to pluck at the strings of his guqin.”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn then felt Lán WàngJī’s hands gradually moving towards his chest, and gently rubbing his nipples, and then, his hands slid down and explored his manhood.</p>
		<p>Soon after, Wèi WúXiàn’s breathing quickened, his chest began to move up and down rapidly. He then lowered his head and looked down.</p>
		<p>As he did so, his gaze fell straight into Lán WàngJī’s eyes. He noted that Lán WàngJī was looking at him with a strong craving.</p>
		<p>The urgent hunger for invading and possessing him completely was written all over Lán WàngJī’s face. And, in the very next moment, Wèi WúXiàn was overwhelming with intense pleasure.</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>Exhausted and fully satisfied, Wèi WúXiàn couldn’t  move a muscle, resting languorously on Lán WàngJī’s arms.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī then did everything for him, from thoroughly washing him and wiping his body to putting clothes on him; the clothes that Wèi WúXiàn had earlier prepared for both of them to wear after bath.</p>
		<p>Then, he carried Wèi WúXiàn to the bed, carefully laid him down, and covered him with a duvet.</p>
		<p>With his head resting on the pillow, Wèi WúXiàn was about to fall asleep directly, when he caught a glimpse of Lán WàngJī sitting on the bed, beside him, and looking at him.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn seemed to have something to say to him, so he forced open his eyes and, in a sleepy voice, he asked, “Lán Zhàn, are you not going to lie on the bed?”</p>
		<p>His sleepy voice sounded so seductive that Lán WàngJī’s ears turned red.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī, however, didn’t answer but said, “You haven’t eaten yet.” He was feeling a little bit guilty.</p>
		<p>“Just go ahead and eat.” Wèi WúXiàn murmured. He was gradually drowsing.</p>
		<p>“I’m not hungry.” replied Lán WàngJī, then, he added, “Sleep. I’ll stay here, by your side.”</p>
		<p>“Lán Zhàn...” The rest of Wèi WúXiàn’s words were inaudible.</p>
		<p>“What did you say?” Lán WàngJī asked, then leaned over so that he could hear what Wèi WúXiàn was saying.</p>
		<p>“Don't be afraid.” Wèi WúXiàn whispered, “I won't leave you. I won’t go anywhere.”</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī’s eyes suddenly widened in surprise, and, at the same time, he couldn’t help but clench his fists tight. Then, he looked at Wèi WúXiàn, his gaze was filled with love and tenderness.</p>
		<p>At that moment, Wèi WúXiàn had already fallen asleep.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī gently kissed him on the forehead, then, he smiled, got into the bed, and lay next to him, he whispered, “Wèi Yīng, I won’t leave you either. I will always stay by your side.”</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>Even though there were not too many cases reported so far in Yúnmèng and Lánlíng territories, however, these regions were densely populated and very prosperous with countless of merchants travelling back and forth.</p>
		<p>If the monster’s wine was still circulated, the matter would get worse.</p>
		<p>As soon as he landed at Jīnlíntái*, Jīn Líng went straight to his room, sat down, and then, using his spiritual energy, he began to regulate his breath.</p>
		<small>*Jīnlíntái is the name of the LánlíngJīn sect residence.</small>
		<p>After he had finished, Jīn Líng poured himself a cup of tea, then took a sip.</p>
		<p>At that moment, a disciple came forward to report to him, he said, “Zōng-zhǔ, Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ is already here waiting for you in the guest room.”</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng was astonished, “Didn’t he ask me to meet him in Yúnmèng in two hours?” he said to himself, “His lack of patience is really getting worse.”</p>
		<p>While pondering that there might be some other important matter that had arisen, Jīn Líng got up at once and headed to the guest room.</p>
		<p>As soon as he entered the room, Jīn Líng saw his uncle with a stern expression on his face, dressed in robes made of purple brocade, standing by the table.</p>
		<p>Jiāng Chéng was tapping his fingers on the table, his almond-shaped eyes seemed to emit lightning, and, without even being angry, he looked very intimidating.</p>
		<p>On the table, there was an open ledger, and in front of him, there were two men kneeling with their heads close to the floor, and slightly trembling in fear. These two were accountants of the LánlíngJīn sect.</p>
		<p>Without seeing it directly, Jīn Líng knew that the ledger had the emblem of his sect, and immediately understood the situation in front of him.</p>
		<p>He gestured to his underling to close the door, then, he angrily said, “You two, raise your heads!” </p>
		<p>Those words were previously uttered by Jiāng Chéng, but the two accountants didn’t dare to look up at him. However, when they noticed that it was Jīn Líng, they hurriedly looked at him and began to beg for mercy, “Zōng-zhǔ, please spare us. We—”</p>
		<p>At that moment, Jiāng Chéng suddenly slapped the table and a purple light flashed from his ring, then, he snorted coldly. The two of them quickly kept their mouths shut.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng was angry, as well as displeased, because he felt that he was not ruthless enough to establish his authority.</p>
		<p>And also, since he was still a young and inexperienced leader, it was hard for him to gain support from other members of his sect.</p>
		<p>He knew very well that he could not keep on relying on his uncle, otherwise, he might not able to become independent.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng composed himself, took a few steps forward, his eyes ran through the open ledger, then, in a stern tone, he said, “Tell me the truth, how much did you spend? Where did you get the wine from? And where have you been circulating that wine?”</p>
		<p>He then added, “Don’t think that you’ll get away with it. I will punish you according to LánlíngJīn’s law. If you dare to cover up—”</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng instantly pulled out Suìhuá and slashed the hair buns of the two accountants.</p>
		<p>The sword light swept across the room with great strength, striking the wall and leaving a deep cut, then, the two men’s hair fell on the floor.</p>
		<p>The hair was cut in a neat and skilful way that it caused Jiāng Chéng to frown in thought, while the two men were so frightened that they collapsed on the floor.</p>
		<p>The two accountants actually didn’t have any ulterior motive, they usually did their work without any mistakes or omissions. So, Jīn Líng suspected that someone else must have been acting in the dark.</p>
		<p>After being thrown into panic, the two men confessed everything, revealing the mastermind behind the scene. It was Jīn Chǎn, Jīn Líng’s cousin, who was plotting all this.</p>
		<p>Back then when they were very young, his cousins used to bully him. And, later on, when Jīn Líng became the leader of their sect, many were unwilling to accept it, and the most dissatisfied one was Jīn Chǎn.</p>
		<p>Luckily for Jīn Líng, Jiāng Chéng often came to visit under the pretence of seeing his nephew, while constantly probing and keeping an eye on everything.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn also occasionally came over along with the young disciples of GūsūLán. On the surface, it seemed like a simple visit, however, under the hood, he checked for any looming shadow.</p>
		<p>After the confession of the two accountants, it turned out that the monster, that had caused trouble for common people, was cultivated by humans.</p>
		<p>It was not an easy task to keep a monster under control. So, at some point, it had escaped and began to harm people.</p>
		<p>And also, Jīn Líng was very furious after he learned that the wine that could confuse people’s mind was specially brought here for Jiāng Chéng and him to drink.</p>
		<p>Then, he thought that since they had learned the truth, if Jīn Chǎn was closely monitoring his every move, chances were that he was likely to go into hiding by now.</p>
		<p>After telling his uncle his thought, Jiāng Chéng said coldly, “<em>The monk may run away, but he cannot take the temple with him.</em>* All his assets will be confiscated. We will settle this account with him eventually.”</p>
		<small>*This Chinese idiom means you can run away, however, you will be caught sooner or later.</small>
		<p>But Jīn Líng nodded with a gloomy expression on his face. When they rushed out to investigate this matter, and finally locate the monster’s lair, then destroy it, he thought that things had turned out well.</p>
		<p>However, he never expected that the source of this matter was within his own sect, which made him feel very frustrated.</p>
		<p>Jiāng Chéng noticed Jīn Líng’s state of mind, however, he wasn’t good at comforting people. So, thinking of Jīn Líng’s early sword slash, he asked, “Did you run into Wèi WúXiàn during your Night Hunting?”</p>
		<p>The question surprised Jīn Líng, nevertheless, he nodded.</p>
		<p>In a displeased way, Jiāng Chéng clicked his tongue, and uttered, “So, he was the one who destroyed the monster’s lair.”</p>
		<p>“No, it was—” Jīn Líng quickly interrupted himself when he suddenly remembered Lán SīZhuī’s request regarding Lán WàngJī’s condition, then, he resumed, “Yes, it was him who did it.”</p>
		<p>Jiāng Chéng obviously noticed Jīn Líng’s hesitation, he frowned and said, “If it was him who did it, so be it. Why are you hesitating?”</p>
		<p>Then, he asked, “Where is he?”</p>
		<p>“Ah?!” Jīn Líng was puzzled as well as stunned. It was as though the answer was not obvious to his uncle. He replied, “He went back to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.”</p>

		<br />
		<p>“He went back before the matter is resolved?!” exclaimed Jiāng Chéng.</p>
		<p>Then, with a hint of doubt in his tone, he said, “Besides, with his personality, it’s quite strange that he didn’t capture that monster alive in order to study it.”</p>
		<p>Although it was hard for him to admit it, Jiāng Chéng knew that Wèi WúXiàn always did things thoroughly, from start to finish.</p>
		<p>This time, however, he went back to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, leaving behind a case that was unique and unheard of! So, obviously, Jiāng Chéng was sceptical about it.</p>
		<p>In the Gūsū territory, people liked to brew their own glutinous rice wine, as well as their exquisite Emperor’s Smile. So, no cases related to that monster’s wine had occurred in their region.</p>
		<p>“Why was he in such a hurry to go back?” Jiāng Chéng pondered, “Could it be that he has been injured?!”</p>
		<p>He then stared at Jīn Líng, and the latter broke out in a cold sweat, he exclaimed: “Uncle, why do you care so much about it? Wèi WúXiàn must have business to attend to. Surely, he should be busy.”</p>
		<p>“Busy?” Jiang Cheng uttered doubtfully, “No matter how busy he is, he will definitely accompany you home. Don't try to hide it from me. Is he injured?”</p>
		<p>Jiang Cheng’s sentence, <em>‘No matter how busy he is, he will definitely accompany you home.’</em>, echoed in Jīn Líng’s head, then, suddenly, he was stunned as if he had been struck by lightning.</p>
		<p>He quickly recalled that each time when they finished their Night Hunting, Wèi WúXiàn would make a shameless excuse to come here, at Jīnlíntái.</p>
		<p>Even when his trip back home to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù was the shortest, Wèi WúXiàn would rather make a detour in order to pass by Jīn Líng’s residence.</p>
		<p>“So, all this time he was making those excuses was actually to escort me home?” Jīn Líng came to the realisation.</p>
		<p>All of a sudden, he was seized by an overwhelming emotion, and couldn't find his words, “Wèi WúXiàn, you’re really—.” he said inwardly, “How someone can possibly describe you?”</p>
		<p>“He did a similar thing this time, too, after we had finished Night Hunting.” Jīn Líng carried on, “Although he had already fixed the date of his return, and even promised HánGuāng-Jūn that he would be back that day, however, at the last minute, when we’ve learned about the incidents that happened in Lánlíng and Yúnmèng territories, not only he changed his plan, but also he urged HánGuāng-Jūn join us to investigate the matter.</p>
		<p>“Each time, he seems ready to go extra mile just for the sake of seeing me back home safely, or helping me solve the issue that happens in Lánlíng territory.”</p>
		<p>Since Jīn Líng didn’t say anything for a while, Jiang Cheng assumed he finally admitted that his speculation about Wèi WúXiàn being injured was true.</p>
		<p>Then, while gritting his teeth, he asked, “Where is Lán WàngJī? Wasn't he with you during the Night Hunting?”</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng became suddenly alarmed, and said inwardly, “Why, out of nowhere, does he bring HánGuāng-Jūn into our conversation?”</p>
		<p>“Yes, he was with us.” he quickly replied.</p>
		<p>“Where is he now?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>
		<p>“He went back to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.” Jīn Líng replied, then thought, “Did my uncle guess about HánGuāng-Jūn? I'm sorry, SīZhuī.”</p>
		<p>Then, with a pleading tone, Jīn Líng said, “Uncle, since you have guessed it, please don't make it public, so as not to cause a turmoil among people.”</p>
		<p>“Don’t make it public?!” Jiang Cheng thundered, while his eyes were blazing with anger, “Who said that?”</p>
		<p>Without letting Jīn Líng reply, he went on, “So, just because he's not technically a member of GūsūLán clan that he can be bullied? And, when something happens to him, it can’t be made public! Well, Lán WàngJī, you've got some guts!”</p>
		<p>Dumbfounded, Jīn Líng asked, “Who doesn't count as a member of GūsūLán clan? Uncle, why are you so angry?”</p>
		<p>“You couldn't even protect him, but you are worried about the commotion that will arise if other people find out?! I will see if you can stop me!” Jiang Cheng carried on furiously.</p>
		<p>“Who didn’t protect who? Jīn Líng kept asking, “Uncle, do you mean that Wèi WúXiàn didn’t protect HánGuāng-Jūn? Why are you so angry that HánGuāng-Jūn is not properly protected?”</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng was confused, and couldn’t figure out why his uncle was so furious. As for Jiang Cheng, since he was already fuming, he paid no heed to what Jīn Líng said.</p>
		<p>He stormed out of the room, drew his Sāndúyù*, stepped on it, and, before flying away, he said, “Jīn Líng, as a sect leader, you must have the demeanour of a leader. While I am away, search the whereabouts of Jīn Chǎn. Did you hear me?”</p>
		<small>*Sāndúyù is the name of Jiang Cheng’s sword.</small>
		<p>Jīn Líng noticed in horror that the direction his uncle took leaded to GūsūLán sect.</p>
		<p>“Does my uncle want to settle accounts with Wèi WúXiàn for HánGuāng-Jūn’s sake?” At this thought, he felt chills running through his body. He suddenly shivered.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng carried on, “Can someone tell me who should I help if those two get into a fight?”</p>
		<p>Then, something crossed his mind, “Wait a minute! This is not good! Uncle, can you beat Wèi WúXiàn?!” Jīn Líng began to worry.</p>
		<p>As the purple light emitted by his uncle’s sword disappeared in the sky like a shooting star, Jīn Líng reacted, wanting to follow him.</p>
		<p>However, before he could step on his sword, Jiang Cheng’s underlings stopped him, and one of them said, “Young Leader, please, don’t take offence. It is wise to prioritise the task that Jiang Zōng-zhǔ has entrusted to you.”</p>
		<p>Thinking of Jīn Chǎn’s case that was still unsolved, Jīn Líng stamped his foot in frustration. However, he was still anxious about a potential fight between his uncle and Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>He then said inwardly, “Oh my, uncle, they have already become a couple, why do you want to meddle in their affairs?”</p>
		<p>Suddenly, he remembered that he had a transmitter talisman, which was given to him by Wèi WúXiàn during their Night Hunting.</p>
		<p>“I almost forget that I have this good stuff.” he said to himself, then quickly returned to his room, took out the talisman from his sleeve, and wrote a few words on it.</p>
		<p>Then, holding the talisman between two fingers, Jīn Líng gathered his spiritual energy to these fingers to burn the talisman.</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn told them that he had improved his transmitter talisman. As long as the receiver had the same talisman on him, he would receive the message immediately after the sender burned his own talisman.</p>
		<p>Jīn Líng had already agreed with Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí that they would communicate to each other via their talismans, so they should receive his message.</p>
		<p>After burning the transmitter talisman, Jīn Líng sent a group of his loyal underlings to seize Jīn Chǎn’s assets, as well as to arrest anyone who had a close relationship with Jīn Chǎn.</p>
		<p>He also planned on taking into account all the transgressions that he had overlooked, and severely punished those who had committed them, without any leniency.</p>
		<p>He then assigned someone to gather information that would lead to Jīn Chǎn's hidden location.</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>In Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù medical care building, doctors were busy taking care of those common people who had been affected by the monster’s wine.</p>
		<p>They had given them some medicines that would restore their energy lost during their capture in the cave.</p>
		<p>According to these doctors’ observation, the pulses of those people were somehow beating faster, and, occasionally, they had nightmares during their sleep.</p>
		<p>Lán Yǎn was the most experienced doctor among others. He had been practising medicine for many generations, and was highly respected.</p>
		<p>However, after probing several times with his spiritual energy, Lán Yǎn could not determine what was wrong with those people, which puzzled him greatly.</p>
		<p>As he was frowning in thought, and staring blankly at the floor, a pair of white boots with silver patterns entered his field of vision.</p>
		<p>He looked up and saw that it was Lán XīChén, and hurriedly saluted him.</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén smiled and said, “Thank you all for your hard work and dedication. I came to see how those people are doing.”</p>
		<p>While stroking his beard, Lán Yǎn informed Lán XīChén about the symptoms he had observed. Then, noting that Lán XīChén seemed not to be surprised, he asked, “Zéwú-Jūn, have you already discovered something about this matter?”</p>
		<p> “Yes.” replied Lán XīChén, “I learned how one of our disciples found a way of eliminating those symptoms.” then, he added, “WàngJī has already woken up.”</p>
		<p>Lán Yǎn exclaimed, “That's great!”</p>
		<p>After a short pause, he said, “Èr-gōngzǐ’s spiritual energy is very powerful. It's not really surprising that he could wake up so quickly.”</p>
		<p>Recalling the scene of his young brother hugging Wèi WúXiàn, and being unwilling to let go of him, Lán XīChén could not help but smiled to himself.</p>
		<p>He then say, “Although he has woken up, however, he is still drunk. And, I don't know what he is doing right now.”</p>
		<p>Surprised, Lán Yǎn remarked, “Since he has regained consciousness, why is he still drunk? That wine is indeed very unusual.”</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén said inwardly, “I'm afraid it's something about WàngJī which is unusual.”</p>
		<p>At that moment, one of those common people began to wriggle his body in panic, and, with his both hands grabbing the edges of the bed, he was muttering some unintelligible words.</p>
		<p>Lán Yǎn was about to go and check on him, but Lán XīChén gently stopped him. He then walked to that person’s bed, took out Lièbīng* and brought it to his lips. A clear and peaceful melody soon filled the room.</p>
		<small>*Lièbīng is the name of Lán XīChén’s flute.</small>
		<p>The sound of that melody was exceptionally gentle and warm. And, Lán Yǎn looked around in surprise. The expressions of those people slowly became calm, and their whole bodies began to relax.</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén carried on playing his flute, while injecting a small amount of his spiritual energy through the melody he produced.</p>
		<p>Soon after, the smell of the wine started to waft away from those people. Lán Yǎn and the other doctors were dumbfounded.</p>
		<p>“This smell is like an evil resentment, it possesses people and goes undetected.” thought Lán Yǎn, “It’s really weird and frightening. Luckily, HánGuāng-Jūn had wiped out all of them. Otherwise, the disaster could have been unimaginable.”</p>
		<p>The doctors held their breath to prevent inhalation of that smell, and retreated further away, leaving Lán XīChén to handle all this.</p>
		<p>With a gentle movement of his right hand, Lán XīChén summon Shuòyuè*. He then swung his sword, and the edge of blade glowed with the spiritual light, that swept across the room.</p>
		<small>*Shuòyuè is the name of Lán XīChén’s sword.</small>
		<p>The strong smell of alcohol was immediately eliminated by the sword energy.</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén then sheathed his sword, and said to the doctors, “Everything should be all right now. Please, keep taking care of those people until they wake up. If there is nothing wrong with their condition, I will get some disciples to escort them to their homes.”</p>
		<p>They all nodded in agreement and took notes of these unusual symptoms for future reference.</p>
		<p>Before Lán XīChén could take his leave, Lán Yǎn asked; “Zéwú-Jūn, does Èr-gōngzǐ need some medicine for the hangover?”</p>
		<p>Thinking of Lán WàngJī acting like a spoiled child when he was drunk, Lán XīChén smiled, and replied, “He probably won’t need it.”</p>
		<p>Glancing at Lán Yǎn who had been attending to them since they were kids, and now his hair had grown grey, Lán XīChén said, “WàngJī has someone who is taking good care of him.”</p>
		<p>Lán Yǎn then understood, smiled with satisfaction, and saw off Lán XīChén at the door.</p>
		<p>When he was young, Lán Yǎn was chosen to be the physician of the GūsūLán lineage.</p>
		<p>However, except for treating injuries of the disciples returning from their Night Hunting, and taking care of some female disciples who were relatively weak, Lán Yǎn and the other doctors didn’t have many occasions to employ their skills.</p>
		<p>This was due to the strict rules of GūsūLán, and all members rigorously observed the sect teachings. Furthermore, they were good at martial art cultivation, and their health condition was excellent.</p>
		<p>However, being in that position, all doctors had to comply with their duties. So, Lán Yǎn had kept practising medicine, and never slacked off in learning.</p>
		<p>To enrich their experience, the doctors were often asked to treat ordinary people, as well. So, they became more respected and loved by everyone.</p>
		<p>After more than ten years of Lán Yǎn’s service at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, Qīnghéng-Jūn ascended to the position of the sect leader, and his younger brother, Lán Qǐrén, was put in charge of the sect rules, as well as educating disciples.</p>
		<p>Lán Yǎn had rarely seen the new leader, except when Qīnghéng-Jūn was young. The only times he had seen Qīnghéng-Jūn were during the important events that were held at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.</p>
		<p>Qīnghéng-Jūn’s popularity was extraordinary. He was tall and graceful. He occasionally smiled despite being taciturn. And all his deeds were admirable.</p>
		<p>Lán Yǎn had thought back then that he would have many interactions with the new leader. However, he didn't expect that Qīnghéng-Jūn would punish himself by going to seclusion for life.</p>
		<p>Marrying someone who killed your shīfu* was really shocking. And, as a sect leader, how could he not impose such a severe punishment to himself?</p>
		<small>*The word ‘shīfu’ doesn’t have a counterpart in English. Sometimes, it is translated as ‘master’ or ‘teacher’, which is incorrect, because the bond between shīfu and his/her disciple is close to parent-child relationship. While protecting his/her disciple, a shīfu passes on knowledge to them.</small>
		<p>Not long after getting married, and just before going to seclusion, Qīnghéng-Jūn said to Lán Yǎn, “My wife is in poor health condition. I hope you will take care of her illness.”</p>
		<p>She was diagnosed as having bones damaged, which affected her cultivation. And, Lán Yǎn had focused in delivering high quality care for her.</p>
		<p>Once, Lán Yǎn saw Qīnghéng-Jūn, with a gentle gaze in his eyes, quietly looking towards Jingshi, the dwelling where his wife was living. Lán Yǎn sighed and said to himself, “He never regrets his decision.”</p>
		<p>Regularly, Lán Yǎn would take the pulse of Lady Qīnghéng. Perhaps, it was because of a long confinement, Lady Qīnghéng was gradually becoming pale and placid, but she never complained, quite contrary, she even had often a smile on her face.</p>
		<p>A few years later, the two jades of GūsūLán clan were born, one after another, on one hand. On the other hand, Lady Qīnghéng’s health condition got worse.</p>
		<p>Since, Lán Yǎn often paid visit to Lady Qīnghéng, he happened to meet the two gōngzǐ who came to see their mother.</p>
		<p>They were looking identical and wearing the same clothes, however, because of their different temperaments, it was easy to distinguish them.</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén had always a warm smile on his face, holding his taciturn young brother’s hand while heading to their mother’s dwelling.</p>
		<p>And, together with his mother, they would chat and laugh. As for Lán WàngJī, no matter how much he was teased, he would remain silent.</p>
		<p>Lán Yǎn would usually stand aside, looking at Lady Qīnghéng, who seemed not to be in good spirits, yet, she would put on a brave face to tease her child.</p>
		<p>When Lán WàngJī was six years old, Lady Qīnghéng couldn’t hold on much longer. And, after being gravely ill for two months, she passed away at the beginning of winter.</p>
		<p>Although she was under house arrest, still, she was the wife of the leader of GūsūLán sect. And, her funeral was modest but meticulously arranged.</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén's eyes were red from crying, while Lán WàngJī remained quiet.</p>
		<p>Three months after the funeral, it had been snowing heavily. And, Lán Yǎn received a message saying that Lán WàngJī had a high fever, and rushed to give him medical treatment.</p>
		<p>Afterwards, Lán Yǎn learned that Lán WàngJī went alone to his mother’s dwelling, then sat in front of the door, waiting for his mother to open the door.</p>
		<p>Lán Qǐrén and Lán XīChén had tried to persuade him many times not to go there, but to no avail. Since he was too young, he caught a cold due to the extreme weather condition.</p>
		<p>Lán Yǎn couldn't bear to see him like this, so he said, “Èr-gōngzǐ, it’s easy to get sick in such cold weather, it’s better not to go there.”</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī looked at Lán Yǎn, then turned his head away without saying anything.</p>

		<br />
		<p>As the years went by, Lán WàngJī’s cultivation was also getting higher. However, he still went to his mother’s dwelling, waiting outside the door that would never open again.</p>
		<p>Everyone could only sighed, feeling helpless.</p>
		<p>Lán Yǎn looked at Lán WàngJī’s back, and it seemed to him that he was looking at their father’s back, and could not help but feel worried.</p>
		<p>His worries would last until Lán WàngJī became an unparalleled cultivator, and a role model for the disciples of his sect until that day, at Nightless Sky City.</p>
		<p>Although Lán Yǎn had been practising medicine for many years, in his whole life, he had never seen such terrible injuries on Lán WàngJī’s back. Neither had he ever seen Lán XīChén looking extremely worried.</p>
		<p>Lán Yǎn and the rest of the physicians didn’t dare to ask the cause of Lán WàngJī’s injuries, they only focused on healing him.</p>
		<p>Soon after, they learned that Lán WàngJī had received such a heavy punishment, because he had defended Wèi WúXiàn by fighting against the elders of his own sect.</p>
		<p>During his sleep, Lán WàngJī would keep whispering his name, “Wèi Yīng.”</p>
		<p>It was hard to tell whether calling his name was helping him soothe his pain, or was because he was grieving for Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>Lán Yǎn felt distressed watching Lán WàngJī in such a state.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī spent three years bedridden with his injuries. After that, he spent ten years going wherever ordinary people were in trouble in order to assist them, while, every single day, he would make enquiries about Wèi WúXiàn to the spirits.</p>
		<p>Finally, after thirteen years since his injuries, Lán WàngJī brought Wèi WúXiàn to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù. Afterwards, they became a married couple.</p>
		<p>Lán Yǎn looked at the newlyweds with satisfaction, watching Lán WàngJī, just like his father, humble yet with an outstanding personality, taking off his forehead ribbon and wrapping it around Wèi WúXiàn’s wrist. At that moment, Lán WàngJī’s face, unlike the usual cold expression, was filled with joy of a wish came true.</p>
		<p>Since then, Lán Yǎn was aware of how happy Lán WàngJī was, and how people around here were praising Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
		<p>And, earlier, he also noticed how pleased Lán XīChén was while referring to Wèi WúXiàn. Lán Yǎn felt that Lán WàngJī’s choice was the best, then went back to taking care of his patients.</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>As he left the medical care building, Lán XīChén began to think about what he had learned regarding the cases occurred in Lánlíng and Yúnmèng territories, He had already dispatched their people to keep an eye on bars and inns of Gūsū territory, just in case.</p>
		<p>Then, his thoughts turned to his young brother, wondering if he was sober now. He then decided to head towards Jingshi to check for himself.</p>
		<p>Although he was sure that Wèi WúXiàn would handle everything just fine, Lán XīChén wanted to be sure that Lán WàngJī was fine.</p>
		<p>Also, since Wèi WúXiàn had a close relationship with both, YúnmèngJiāng and LánlíngJīn sects, he thought that he could discuss the matter with him.</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>In Jingshi, Lán WàngJī was sitting at the edge of the bed, gazing pleasingly at Wèi WúXiàn, who was sleeping soundly.</p>
		<p>For someone who was usually lively, Wèi WúXiàn looked like a quiet person while sleeping, which made him look more adorable.</p>
		<p>Unlike him to throw in the towel so easily during their lovemaking, and hadn’t let out his usual load and horny moans, showed how Wèi WúXiàn was exhausted.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī had noticed it, however, since he was still drunk, he couldn’t suppress his desire of making love to him. And no matter how many times Wèi WúXiàn begged him to have mercy on him, Lán WàngJī would pretend not to hear his pleading until Wèi WúXiàn could no longer bear it.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī gently pulled the duvet over Wèi WúXiàn, and adjusted the collar of his robe so to cover some love bites.</p>
		<p>Since he had been in coma for hours, and also, right now it was far before the bedtime set according to GūsūLán rules, Lán WàngJī was not feeling sleepy at all.</p>
		<p>He then looked across the room—there was a significant amount of water splashed on the floor due to their early activity on the bathtub; that activity had also caused the wooden bathtub to be slightly deformed, likely enough, it was still in one piece; and on the screen divider, clothes had been randomly hanged, while some had been thrown on the floor.</p>
		<p>Looking at this mess for a while, and besides not being completely sober, Lán WàngJī’s cleanliness took over. He stood up and walked over to clean up.</p>
		<p>Just he was about to pick up clothes on the floor, Lán WàngJī sensed someone approaching their door. He slightly frowned, walked calmly to the door and opened it.</p>
		<p>Surprised, Lán XīChén, who was about to knock on the door, slowly lowered his hand, as the door opened before he could do the knocking.</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén looked at his young brother in disbelief—the latter was only wearing a thin garment, and his facial expression was as calm as ever.</p>
		<p>A rictus appeared on the corner of Lán XīChén’s mouth, as he scanned Lán WàngJī up and down, thinking that this scene was happening in broad daylight.</p>
		<p>Lán WàngJī then uttered, “Xiōng-zhǎng.”</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén quickly cleared his throat, and began, “Sorry, WàngJī. Can you please—”</p>
		<p>At that precise moment, a whimper of pain was heard, coming from the room, followed by the rustling sound of someone tossing and turning. Immediately, Lán WàngJī closed the door, leaving his older brother outside.</p>
		<p>Lán XīChén was staggered by Lán WàngJī’s action, he said, “Is WàngJī still drunk?”</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>At the entrance of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, Jiang Cheng landed, then stepped off of his sword.</p>
		<p>The two disciples in charge of guarding the gate hurried forward and saluted him. One of them politely said, “We were not aware that Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ was coming. Please forgive us for not giving you a proper welcome.”</p>
		<p>Jiang Cheng curbed his anger, nodded slightly in response, and said, “I’m here to discuss some important matter with HánGuāng-Jūn. I hope you will inform him without delay.”</p>
		<p>Since they didn’t know that Lán WàngJī had already woken up, the other disciple replied, “Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ, right now, it is inconvenient for HánGuāng-Jūn to receive visitors. Please accept our apologies. If the matter is urgent, could you please discuss it with Zéwú-Jūn?”</p>
		<p>Jiang Cheng could not help but clench his fist, he thought, “Lán WàngJī is not in a position to receive guests. Apparently, something really happened to Wèi WúXiàn during their Night Hunting.”</p>
		<p>He then replied, “All right.”</p>
		<p>The two disciples simultaneously said, “Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ, please follow us.”</p>
		<p>As Jiang Cheng walked past the gate, they heard someone saying, “Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ, please wait!”</p>
		<p>Jiang Cheng saw Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí rushing towards him. From the looks of it, they came over to stop him. His facial expression suddenly darkened.</p>
		<p>Looking at Jiang Cheng's gloomy face, Lán SīZhuī took a deep breath, not knowing where to start. Not long ago, he received Jīn Líng’s message saying, “My uncle is heading to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù to settle accounts with Wèi WúXiàn. If you can, send him away so to prevent them getting into a fight.”</p>
		<p>“I didn’t expect anyone to be aware of my coming here.” Jiang Cheng sneered.</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī knew that Jiang Cheng had a bad temperament, and, although Wèi WúXiàn and Wēn Níng no longer had bad reputations, Jiang Cheng hadn’t let go of his grudge.</p>
		<p>He then bit the bullet and said, “Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ, please forgive my boldness. May I have a word with you?”</p>
		<p>Jiang Cheng coldly snorted, “It is well known that GūsūLán sect has strict rules. Why are their disciples lack of respect?”</p>
		<p>Annoyed, Lán JǐngYí retorted, “Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ, why are you saying that SīZhuī is disrespectful. He politely asked to talk to you about the urgent matter.”</p>
		<p>“If you have an urgent matter, why didn’t you tell Jīn Líng to inform me?” Jiang Cheng counterattacked.</p>
		<p>Then, while fiddling with Zǐdiàn* on his ring finger,  he sneered, “I don’t think you have something to say to me—you are actually trying to conceal something.”</p>
		<small>*Zǐdiàn is a ring that, when it is used as weapon, changes into a whip.</small>
		<p>In a stern tone, Jiang Cheng asked, “Where is Wèi WúXiàn?”</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī nervously said, “Jiāng Zōng-zhǔ, please listen to me.”</p>
		<p>Jiang Cheng frowned, grabbed one of the two disciples by the neck. His fingertips, glowing with purple light, were pressed against that disciple’s throat. He stormed, “I don’t want to hear any more nonsense. Tell me where Wèi WúXiàn is?”</p>
		<p>Shaking with fear under the pressure of Jiang Cheng’s powerful spiritual energy, the disciple quickly replied, “He is in Jingshi, which is located on the other side of the mountain.”</p>
		<p>Jiang Cheng abruptly released him, stepped on his sword and flew towards Jingshi.</p>
		<p>The poor thing, who had collapsed on the ground, got up, feeling embarrassed by his submissiveness, he said to Lán SīZhuī, “Shī-xiōng*, I'm sorry.”</p>
		<small>*Shī-xiōng means senior brother (in any learning skills, e.g.: martial art, medicine, etc.).</small>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī hadn’t expected Jiang Cheng to react so aggressively—he actually threatened a GūsūLán disciple while being at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù!</p>
		<p>Anxious, Lán SīZhuī became confused at the same time. Jīn Líng was safe and sound—nothing happened to him. So, what caused Jiang Cheng to want to clash with Wèi WúXiàn?</p>
		<p>Gritting his teeth, Lán SīZhuī said inwardly, “Sometimes, Wèi-qiánbèi secretly works hard to solve issues that occur in Yúnmèng and Lánlíng territories.</p>
		<p>“He once was a YúnmèngJiāng disciple, so he should be regarded as Jīn Líng’s uncle, as well.</p>
		<p>“Although he now becomes part of GūsūLán sect and HánGuāng-Jūn’s partner, Wèi-qiánbèi is still doing his best to protest the two of them.”</p>
		<p>Lán SīZhuī didn’t have time to cheer his Shī-dì* up, he only said, “Don’t tell anyone about what happened here.”</p>
		<small>*Shī-dì means junior brother, it’s the opposite of Shī-xiōng.</small>
		<p>Then, with Lán JǐngYí, they stepped on their swords and followed Jiang Cheng.</p>
		<br />
		<p>... ... ...</p>
		<br />
		<p>It was pitch dark in here. From a far distance, one could see some lights faintly shone like stars in the night sky.</p>
		<p>“What is this place? Why is it so dark and noisy?”</p>
		<p>A voice seemed to come from far, however, it was too noisy to distinguish the spoken words. It looked like many people were yelling continuously, but their figures appeared like countless shadows packed like a large herd of cattle.</p>
		<p>“Why are they shouting?”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn felt his whole arching; he could not see where he was heading; it was getting harder to continue walking; and he felt like giving up but a strong will kept his body moving forward.</p>
		<p>He tried to grab something for support but there’s nothing around him—a complete emptiness.</p>
		<p>From time to time, the same voice reached him, but there was no one in sight, and no place to return to.</p>
		<p>He could not recall any name to call out. Even if he did, he wasn’t even sure that someone would reply to him.</p>
		<p>“Wèi-gōngzǐ?”</p>
		<p>“Who is calling me?” Wèi WúXiàn wondered.</p>
		<p>“Gōngzǐ, are you all right?” the same voice came again.</p>
		<p>Surprised, Wèi WúXiàn said to himself, “It’s Wēn Níng!”</p>
		<p>“Wèi WúXiàn, why did you buy potatoes again? What about the radishes?” another voice reached him.</p>
		<p>“This is Wen Qing’s voice!” Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed.</p>
		<p>He began to run towards where the voices came from, staggering along the way, and saying, “I am here. Where are you?”</p>
		<p>“Xian-gēge, it's so dark here.”</p>
		<p>“A-Yuàn?!” Wèi WúXiàn felt his heart sank. “Where is A-Yuàn? Where did I leave A-Yuàn?”</p>
		<p>Suddenly, someone yelled, “Yílíng Lǎozǔ is here!”</p>
		<p>Extremely shocked, Wèi WúXiàn turned around just in time to grab the arrow that was aimed at him. The darkness had dissipated, revealing a crowd of people, holding torches, encircled him.</p>
		<p>“Wèi WúXiàn! You evil heretic! You won’t escape today!”</p>
		<p>“Today we will uphold justice in the name of heaven!”</p>
		<p>“Let's work together to destroy this demon!”</p>
		<p>“Let’s kill him!”</p>
		<p>“It's too noisy.” Wèi WúXiàn repeated these words in his head for a while, then, suddenly, he shouted, “You are too noisy!”</p>
		<p>At the same time, he hurled the arrow he had snatched back to his assailant, and it pierced his neck.</p>
		<p>People around looked terrified by the counter-attack. Others hurriedly encouraged them, “Don’t be afraid! Let’s kill this devil and take the Yin Tiger Talisman!”</p>
		<p>“That’s right! We can’t the Yin Tiger Talisman into his hands!”</p>
		<p>Wèi WúXiàn sneered, “Well, well! You are just a bunch of self-righteous, despicable people under the banner of justice. You all are just coveting the Yin Tiger Talisman.”</p>
		<p>Demons in the mass burial seemed to have sensed Wèi WúXiàn’s killing intent, began to get moving.</p>
		<p>Placing Chénqíng against his lips, Wèi WúXiàn uttered, “Come on! Attack me if you dare! Today, I will let all of you experience what it feels like to have no way back.”</p>
