By channelling Wèi WúXiàn’s unconscious mind, Lán WàngJī discovered how much Wèi WúXiàn loved and cared about him.

Recalling those memories, Lán WàngJī felt the strong emotion that made him lose control of himself, the feeling of being loved by the one he deeply loved, resulting in him making love to Wèi WúXiàn in a way that was way too fast and vigorous.

Feeling overwhelmed by Lán WàngJī’s powerful back and forth movements, inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Is it because this is the first time we do the doggy style that it feels too intense?

“Or, is it because of the way Lán Zhàn pecked me on the cheek that has set fire in me?

“Or, is it because of the reflection of Lán Zhàn’s eyes in the mirror that shows how deeply he loves and wants me?

“Whatever it is, however, right now, making Lán Zhàn feel good will satisfy me more than anything else.”

Then, as he could no longer hold it, Wèi WúXiàn released his white fluid while calling his darling’s name. And then, he lost consciousness and collapsed on the dressing table.

Regaining his self-control as a result, Lán WàngJī, surprised, called him, “Wèi Yīng?”

Somehow, he felt satisfied to see that his Wèi Yīng passed out because he made him feel so good. This satisfaction calmed down his burning desire for Wèi WúXiàn.

He then pulled out his manhood, took the fallen stool, placed it back in its original place, and sat on it. Then, he took the unconscious Wèi WúXiàn and made him sit on his lap, with his face facing the mirror.

As he did so, he also at the same time inserted his huge stuff inside Wèi WúXiàn.

“Aagh...” Wèi WúXiàn let out a moan as the hot stuff penetrated inside his sensitive hole, causing him to regain consciousness.

Wèi WúXiàn seemed to have heard Lán WàngJī chuckle faintly. Then, he realised that, this time, because of Lán WàngJī’s overpowered back and forth movements, he came too early.

And, right now, he didn’t have any strength left, and all he could do was to rest complaisantly on Lán WàngJī’s arms, with his head leaned against Lán WàngJī’s shoulder.

Lán WàngJī had not started to move yet; he was quietly watching Wèi WúXiàn via the mirror, enjoying the steamy expression on his face.

Becoming aware of being watched, Wèi WúXiàn felt a little bit shy. “Èr-gēge,” he called as he raised his head towards Lán WàngJī’s face, with an expression on his face that said, “Kiss me.”

Lán WàngJī lowered his head and began to kiss him; then, slowly, he started to move inside Wèi WúXiàn.

“Uhh...” Wèi WúXiàn began to moan as Lán WàngJī hit his weak spot with each of his gentle forth movements, causing him to tremble slightly.

Lán WàngJī then let go of his mouth and brought his lips close to Wèi WúXiàn’s ear. He asked, “You don’t like it?”

“Ah!” inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “He really wants to hear me say ‘I like it.’ Lán Zhàn is really naughty. He is actually naughtier when he is moving slowly than faster.”

As Wèi WúXiàn didn’t reply, Lán WàngJī stopped moving, held Wèi WúXiàn’s chin, gently brought his lips close to his own lips, and gave him a long and deep kiss.

Aroused by the kiss, Wèi WúXiàn involuntarily curled his toes as Lán WàngJī took his time in kissing him.

Furthermore, even though Lán WàngJī was not moving, Wèi WúXiàn could still feel the heat of his hot stuff; he could clearly sense the regular pulse of his huge manhood along the wall of his hole. All this was driving him mad.

“Lán Zhàn, move... move already,” Wèi WúXiàn pleaded, unable to bear this growing arousal.

He could have done the up and down movements himself if it were not for the pain he felt on his waist where Lán WàngJī had held him earlier.

“Wèi Yīng, right now, all I want is to kiss you.” His voice was low and deep, which caused Wèi WúXiàn to surrender.

He replied, “All right, then. Kiss me as much as you want.” He then warmly welcomed him, and the two of them kissed each other passionately.

After the kisses, both were out of breath. Wèi WúXiàn then turned his head and watched Lán WàngJī via the mirror. He noticed that Lán WàngJī’s chest was slightly moving up and down, swaying him a little bit.

He also noted that, despite his calm expression, Lán WàngJī’s eyes betrayed the fierce emotion he was feeling. This emotion was extremely set on fire by their kisses.

Just by watching Lán WàngJī’s eyes, Wèi WúXiàn became more horny than he already was. Then, he realised and said, inwardly, “Lán Zhàn has not released yet.”

Forgetting the pain in his waist, Wèi WúXiàn began to move his bottom up and down, squeezing Lán WàngJī from time to time.

Then, in a provocative way, he said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, I won’t stop until you come.”

As a result, Lán WàngJī, who earlier had calmed himself down, was once more losing control.

He held Wèi WúXiàn by the waist and made him stand up; then, he stood up himself and put the stool very close to the dressing table.

And then, in a commanding tone, he said, “Put your hands on the dressing table and your knees on the stool.”

“What?!” Wèi WúXiàn was shocked. “Do I have to?” It seemed to him that Lán WàngJī had more than one or two tricks up his sleeve.

Lán WàngJī simply replied, “Yes,” with his eyes burning hot, while his voice remained calm.

Inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn said to himself, “I should just do what he says. After all, I was the one who provoked him in the first place.”

Then, he leaned his upper body over the dressing table and put his knees on the stool. And then, in a low voice, he asked, “The stool would not be overturned?”

As a reply, Lán WàngJī produced two blue string-like lights and made them fasten themselves on the stool so that one string was on one side of the stool while the other was on the other side.

Then, the other end of the strings penetrated through the floor and stuck there, firmly holding the stool.

“String killing technique!” Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed inwardly, “Is it really okay to use that? This is definitely not Lán Zhàn’s style. It looks like his future self digs a hole, which is waiting for his current self to jump in.”

Then, using both thumbs, Lán WàngJī vigorously parted Wèi WúXiàn’s small opening, inserted his manhood, and then began to move.

“Hah...” Wèi WúXiàn moaned. Although it was a similar position as before, since this time his knees were resting on the stool, it allowed Lán WàngJī to go deeper inside him and hit his P-spot.

Lán WàngJī also felt an intense sensation as Wèi WúXiàn’s legs were close together, which caused Wèi WúXiàn’s hole to tighten around his manhood and suck him with every move he made.

Wèi WúXiàn’s legs had already begun to tremble because of the pleasure he felt.

It seemed that there was no need to secure the stool since Lán WàngJī held Wèi WúXiàn by the hips so that his knees would not weigh on the stool.

Noticing this subtle consideration, Wèi WúXiàn was delighted and spared no efforts to tease Lán WàngJī, “HánGuāng-Jūn, you have really made great progress.

“Not only do you want to face the mirror while doing it, but also you want my bottom to be raised so that you have a full view of your thrusts. You have become shameless. What a waste for your upstanding sect.”

Undisturbed, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you are also a member of the GūsūLán sect.”

Via the mirror, Wèi WúXiàn could see in Lán WàngJī’s eyes that the storm was coming. “Oh! That’s right! I am also part of the GūsūLán sect,” he replied.

Wèi WúXiàn’s acceptance of being a member of the GūsūLán sect made Lán WàngJī feel really happy. And, because of the inconvenience of the posture, he wasn’t moving too fast.

Moreover, his moderate back and forth movements allowed him to enjoy how Wèi WúXiàn was unable to bear the intense pleasure of being penetrated from behind.

“Aargh... Èr-gēge, have you not become bigger?”

Wèi WúXiàn had rested his upper body on the dressing table, and, right now, it was his whole body that was trembling, as the inside of his hole was still very sensitive.

Overwhelmed with pleasure, Wèi WúXiàn pleaded, “Lán Zhàn, can we take a break?”

“Wèi Yīng, you said earlier that you won’t stop until I release,” replied Lán WàngJī while he kept on moving at the same pace. Then he added, “And also, I have just started moving.”

“Haaah... Èr-gēge, I take back what I have said. You are too big.”

“Wèi Yīng, one of GūsūLán rules says, ‘You cannot go back on your words.’ Since you are a member of the GūsūLán sect, you must comply with the GūsūLán rules.”

“Is there such a rule?” asked Wèi WúXiàn, then, subconsciously, he murmured, “Is it the eighty-seventh rule on the wall?”

Surprised, Lán WàngJī paused and asked, “Do you remember this rule?”

Wèi WúXiàn was himself surprised. Back then, he had copied the GūsūLán rules so many times; still, he could not remember most of them clearly, let alone the order they appeared on the wall.

Lán WàngJī then understood that Wèi WúXiàn didn’t recall the rule but said it without realising it himself. Still, it was enough to make Lán WàngJī feel fully satisfied.

“He is indeed mine,” thought Lán WàngJī. “Not only has he not forgotten about me, but also he can subconsciously remember the rules of GūsūLán.

“At this point, I don’t think I won’t be able to restrain myself. I want to blend together our bodies and souls.”
