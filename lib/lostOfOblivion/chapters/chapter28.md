Amazed by the foetal activity, Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “He kicked me!”

“Just like I said before, he is moving,” Mián-Mián proudly said.

Luó QīngYáng smiled and said, “Right now, you better stay in my belly and be good.” Then she went on, “Every day, he is wiggling all day long. I will be busy after giving birth to him.”

At that precise moment, Lán SīZhuī entered the room holding Little Apple, who was sleeping. Lán JǐngYí followed behind and seemed like he didn’t dare to hold such a tiny baby.

Mián-Mián got excited when she saw the baby; however, she didn’t dare to draw near her.

Wèi WúXiàn laughed at her. “You see, it’s not that easy to take care of a baby. You don’t even dare to come closer. What you need is to learn little by little.”

Mián-Mián was not yet convinced; she said, “Uncle Wèi, I don’t think that you know how to look after a baby.”

“I just want to know,” said Wèi WúXiàn, “why are you calling me ‘uncle’?

“Right now, I am lacking twenty years of memories, which are equivalent to twenty years ago, which, in turn, means I am twenty years younger.

“So, for now, call me ‘Gēge'* until I recover my memories; then, at that time, you can call me ‘uncle’.”

<small>*Gēge means elder brother.</small>

“Anyone who knows how to look after a baby should be called ‘uncle’,” replied Mián-Mián. “Didn’t you say that you have taken care of this baby?”

Luó QīngYáng laughed, then said, “Wèi-gōngzǐ, according to HánGuāng-Jūn’s account, you had taken care of her at most half a day.

“How about my husband and I give both of you some tips on how to look after a baby?”

Wèi WúXiàn replied, “All right. It’s good to have many skills.”

Luó QīngYáng then held Little Apple in her arms and began her guidance.

Lán WàngJī listened attentively and memorised everything that had been said.

After having dinner together, some of the disciples escorted Luó QīngYáng and Mián-Mián to the guest house.

Lín Ruì, who stayed behind, said to Wèi WúXiàn, “Wèi-gōngzǐ, there are things that QīngYáng thinks are not essential in telling you. As for me, I’m not good at talking.”

Lín Ruì became a little bit shy, and his face turned slightly red. He carried on, “Wèi-gōngzǐ, right now, I’m really happy. I have a good wife and an adorable daughter, and soon, I’ll have a son. My happiness is due to your bravery in saving QīngYáng.

“You have done a lot of good deeds. You are really a wonderful person. I’m so grateful to you for what you have done for QīngYáng.”

On their way back to Jingshi, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Did you invite them in the hope that I would remember some past events?”

“Yes and no,” replied Lán WàngJī. “I sent the invitation letter when I found out that you have lost your memories.

“However, they had set off as soon as they heard that you have been found. In other words, they were on their way here when I sent the letter.”

Then, he added, “Wèi Yīng, Mrs Lín and her family do really care about you.”

When they arrived, they saw Lán SīZhuī, holding Little Apple, waiting at the porch.

“Each time we brought Little Apple, she was always asleep,” said Lán SīZhuī. “Now that she is awake, I brought her so you can see her.

“She has been sleeping a lot these days; it’s around this time that she wakes up.”

Wèi WúXiàn was extremely happy to see Little Apple awake. He took her and cradled her in his arms the way Luó QīngYáng taught them earlier.

He slid one hand under the baby’s head and the other under her bottom, and then he lifted the baby.

Next step, he nestled the baby’s head in the crook of his arm, cupping the baby’s bottom with the other hand, and then he held her close.

Little Apple then began to wave her little hands in the air and patted Wèi WúXiàn’s face in the process. She seemed to like Wèi WúXiàn’s smooth skin and started to pinch his face.

Wèi WúXiàn slightly cried out, “Aah! You are just a tiny little thing; why are you so strong?”

Lán SīZhuī had a rattle hanging on his waist belt. He took it off and began to shake the toy to play with the baby.

Immediately, Little Apple spread her arms, wanting Lán SīZhuī to hold her.

Lán SīZhuī then handed the toy to Wèi WúXiàn; however, Little Apple still wanted him to hold her.

Wèi WúXiàn passed over the rattle to Lán WàngJī, who, at once, started to shake it gently in front of the baby.

Little Apple then stopped making a fuss and let Wèi WúXiàn hold her.

After playing for a while, Little Apple became sleepy. After all, she was only three months old. So, Lán SīZhuī took her to bring her back to the convent.

Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn saw him off at the gate of their front garden. Then, all of a sudden, Lán SīZhuī turned around and called, “Xiàn-gēge*.”

<small>*Xiàn is taken from WúXiàn, and also Lán SīZhuī used to call Wèi WúXiàn ‘Xiàn-gēge’ when he was a kid.</small>

Wèi WúXiàn got puzzled. When he chatted with Lán SīZhuī, the latter had kept calling him ‘Wèi-qiánbèi’. Why did he change the way he was calling him?

Lán SīZhuī explained himself, “I called you ‘Xiàn-gēge’ because I heard you saying to Mián-Mián that you wanted to be called ‘Gēge’.”

“You are indeed a smart kid and well-mannered,” Wèi WúXiàn praised him.

Unexpectedly, Lán SīZhuī didn’t want to show any modesty; instead, he happily nodded his head and agreed, “Certainly.”

He then said, “I am very diligent in doing my homework and pay great attention during Night Hunting. I also remember everything that Lán Lǎo, HánGuāng-Jūn and you taught me.

“I often get high grades and have recently started to lead my juniors when we go for Night Hunting.”

Having boastfully said that much about himself, Lán SīZhuī’s face turned slightly red in embarrassment. “I… I have grown up well.”

With a smile on his face, Wèi WúXiàn said, “I know that you are a good kid.”

“Xiàn-gēge, I am A-Yuan.” As he said that, Lán SīZhuī’s eyes began to turn red, like someone who was holding back his tears.

Then, as a joke, he added, “It’s too bad that I can’t cling* onto your leg, since I’m holding Little Apple.”

<small>*Lán SīZhuī (little A-Yuan), as a kid, used to hang on tight to Wèi WúXiàn’s leg like a little monkey.</small>

After seeing off Lán SīZhuī, Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn went to the backyard and sat side by side under the magnolia tree.

While slowly drinking Emperor’s Smile, Wèi WúXiàn held Lán WàngJī’s arm and leaned his head against his shoulder.

“Lán Zhàn, many good things had indeed happened,” said Wèi WúXiàn.

In a warm tone, Lán WàngJī agreed, “Yes.”

While gently rubbing his head on Lán WàngJī’s shoulder, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, do you know all the history books of the GūsūLán library? Are their contents accurate?

“Because I’m planning on using the history as an anchor.”

Lán WàngJī replied, “The contents of the history books are not adequate to be used as an anchor.

“We have an incense burner in our room that helps you enter into a dream. Now, we can even decide on which dream we want to enter.

“So, if you enter into my dream and use the events in my dream as an anchor, you should be able to recall all your lost memories.”

“You don’t need to do that,” quickly uttered Wèi WúXiàn. He didn’t want Lán WàngJī to experience again the bad memories.

Lán WàngJī earnestly said, “Wèi Yīng, I want to be by your side when you enter into a dream. Let me be by your side to assist you.”

Wèi WúXiàn stared open-mouthed at Lán WàngJī; he was deeply moved by his eagerness.

As he kept on looking at him, Wèi WúXiàn became dazzled by Lán WàngJī’s eyes gleaming like a starry sky.

He then helplessly covered his face with his hands, then he looked at Lán WàngJī and said, “Lán Zhàn, when we discuss serious matters, you should not look at me like that. Otherwise, I won’t be able to resist.”

“Okay,” replied Lán WàngJī.

Then, a warm smile appeared on his face, which at once melted Wèi WúXiàn’s heart. Irresistibly, Wèi WúXiàn smiled back at him.

Afterwards, they looked up to the sky, admiring the bright and beautiful full moon, which looked like a white jade disc. Here and there, the sky was covered with stars.

Wèi WúXiàn then felt his mind had been cleared up. He put down the jar of wine and, gracefully, climbed the magnolia tree.

Lán WàngJī stood up and looked up at him. The moonlight was showering on him, forming a halo around his body. He then approached close to the tree and spread his arms towards Wèi WúXiàn.

Standing on the treetop and looking all smiles, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, I’m ready.”

Lán WàngJī replied, “Okay.”

“Lán Zhàn, I don’t want to forget why you got injured because of me,” Wèi WúXiàn said. “Also, I want to remember all the good things that happened after I came back.”

“All right,” said Lán WàngJī.

“Will you assist me?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.

In a determined way, Lán WàngJī replied, “I will be by your side when you recall all the past events.”

Wèi WúXiàn laughed heartily, and then he threw himself into Lán WàngJī’s open arms.
