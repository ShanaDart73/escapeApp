Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, I am so elegantly dressed as though I’m going back to school again.” Then he added, “I still remember what Lán Lǎo asked us as a question back then:

‘If a criminal has been executed, and his body has been exposed for seven days, and, as a result, his corpse has been filled with resentment, which methods would you use to deal with it?’”

Lán WàngJī felt his chest tighten a little bit by this sensitive topic. However, he only said, “What would you do?”

“First, purify its soul. Second, suppress it if the first method fails. And, finally, if the second method also fails, annihilate it.” Then he went on, “It’s what you replied. You’re always right.”

Lán WàngJī then said, “There is a fourth method. It’s what you replied, and you were right.”

“My method is precarious,” said Wèi WúXiàn. “Demonic power is very complex. There are some features that are good to be used and others that are not and must be discarded.”

He went on, “Lán Zhàn, you have already helped me restore my Golden Core. From now on, I’ll be using mostly my spiritual power and less of my demonic power.”

He then leaned his head on Lán WàngJī’s shoulder and gently stroked Lán WàngJī’s back. With a sweet smile on his face, he said, “Ér Gege, I’ll behave.”

Lán WàngJī remained silent; his well-behaved Wèi Yīng once cut off his own Golden Core and then was trapped in the pit of burial ground. Back then, he used to stare at his back figure, feeling powerless for being unable to change the course of events.

He also used to listen to Wèi WúXiàn saying that he didn’t have other choices than walking on the wrong side of the road.

Now that he had a Golden Core, he no longer needed to walk on that side.

They had worked together to form a new Golden Core; however, Wèi WúXiàn chose to give up on his Golden Core for him. Fortunately, he was able to help him restore his Golden Core.

Right now, a dazzling Golden Core was residing in his Golden Core vessel. And, this time, he would protect him.

Wèi WúXiàn had gone back to the mirror to look at himself again. He then saw in the mirror that Lán WàngJī had followed him.

He watched Lán WàngJī via the mirror as the latter embraced him from the back.

Wèi WúXiàn saw him close his eyes and noticed that his eyelashes trembled slightly.

As Lán WàngJī’s face slowly got close to his, a warm breath caressed his forehead, then, affectionately, Lán WàngJī kissed his forehead.

That one kiss was not enough to satisfy Lán WàngJī.

Wèi WúXiàn was still watching his every action via the mirror. He saw him leaning his head towards his face one more time; then, his lips gently brushed his cheek, like a touch of a dandelion clock.

Even though his handsome darling had already made his heart beat fast many times before, this time, however, Wèi WúXiàn felt as though his heart would pop out of his chest.

“Lán Zhàn...” inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn called his name. Then he noticed in the mirror that his own face had turned scarlet like a red maple leaf.

“Lán...” As he turned his head towards Lán WàngJī, in a low voice, Wèi WúXiàn began to call him but stopped abruptly when his lips brushed his sweetheart’s lips.

For a while, they gazed at each other mesmerically.

“His way of looking at me sets my body on fire,” thought Wèi WúXiàn.

Lán WàngJī then leaned his head and began to kiss Wèi WúXiàn eagerly, licking and sucking his lips, exploring his mouth with the tip of his tongue.

“Aaah...” Wèi WúXiàn felt some warm and comfortable sensation in his back, where Lán WàngJī’s hands were caressing him.

He murmured, “In broad daylight, is it not indecent? How... how many times have we already done it?”

Lán WàngJī let go of his mouth but kept on stroking his back. And, when he talked, his voice sounded a little bit guilty, “Wèi Yīng... I want you, once again.”

Wèi WúXiàn felt something hard and warm against his loins. Apparently, Lán WàngJī was not able to suppress his desire for him.

After feeling Lán WàngJī’s manhood brush against him, Wèi WúXiàn also became horny and didn’t mind the daylight any longer.

Without hesitation, Wèi WúXiàn removed his trousers, and then he said, “Since you want me, then, let’s do it. I’ll receive you whenever you want me.”

Then, he noticed that, in a flash, Lán WàngJī’s eyes became similar to those of a predator ready to jump on its prey, which frightened him a little bit.

However, it was too late to draw back, as Lán WàngJī pushed him over the dressing table, then kicked aside the stool, which ended up turning over. And the sound produced by the fallen stool startled Wèi WúXiàn.

And, at the same time, he could not believe his eyes. “What? He wants to do it right here, in front of the mirror!”

To support himself, Wèi WúXiàn put his elbows on the dressing table. Then, he felt two slender fingers being swiftly inserted in his hole.

Lán WàngJī vigorously moved his fingers inside Wèi WúXiàn, and, very soon, a watery sound was produced.

Listening to the sound coming from his hole, Wèi WúXiàn was surprised by his own prompt reaction. And, before his “Be gentle” phrase could slip out of his mouth, he quickly swallowed it back.

Lán WàngJī then withdrew his fingers and thrust the head of his huge stuff in Wèi WúXiàn’s hole.

“Argh.” With a voice that sounded like a moan, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Are we not going to bed?”

“No. There’s no need,” replied Lán WàngJī. Then, he held Wèi WúXiàn by his waist, and, in a commanding tone, he said, “Wèi Yīng, raise your buttocks.”

Since he had sensed a lack of patience in Lán WàngJī’s voice, Wèi WúXiàn obediently did what he was told. He lowered his upper body, which made it easy for him to raise his bottom, hence, giving himself completely to Lán WàngJī.

Without further delay, Lán WàngJī inserted his whole manhood inside Wèi WúXiàn, and, without showing any patience, he began to move back and forth.

“Aaah... argh.” While moaning, Wèi WúXiàn thought, “This is way too fast.”

Although they had just started, the sound produced by Lán WàngJī’s powerful thrusts indicated that Wèi WúXiàn’s hole had already swallowed him in full.

As the sound of their lovemaking could clearly be heard, Wèi WúXiàn thought that he got used to it too quickly and felt a little bit defeated.

Raising his head slightly, Wèi WúXiàn looked at their reflections in the mirror. His face was turned peach with his eyes looking steamy, while Lán WàngJī’s facial expression was still calm.

“If you’re not looking at his back-and-forth movements, you won’t be able to guess what he is doing,” thought Wèi WúXiàn, then, with some malicious intention, he squeezed Lán WàngJī tight.

As a result, Lán WàngJī let out a low and hoarse moan.

Wèi WúXiàn then became naughtier. He began to move his bottom in such a way to pleasure Lán WàngJī even more.

Then, he asked, “Lán Zhàn, why is your face still unchanged? Am I not giving you a good service?”

Although he was wearing the strict GūsūLán uniform, as well as the forehead ribbon that conveyed self-control, Wèi WúXiàn’s temperament was still the same.

As a result of Wèi WúXiàn’s naughtiness, Lán WàngJī, despite himself, tightened his grip on Wèi WúXiàn’s waist and began to move even faster.

Wèi WúXiàn then could no longer move his buttocks. Furthermore, his moans became louder.

Looking in the mirror, Wèi WúXiàn watched his erotic expression as Lán WàngJī kept bumping inside him.

Then, when he was about to say something else, Lán WàngJī spoke first, “Wèi Yīng, don’t speak.”

Inwardly, Lán WàngJī said, “I can barely control myself right now. If Wèi Yīng says something again, I won’t be able to control myself, which might inflict some injuries on him.”

Wèi WúXiàn didn’t dare to say whatever he wanted to say. Unconsciously, each time Lán WàngJī used a dominant tone, he would quickly behave.

In the mirror, their lower bodies were not reflected. The only reflection that could be seen was of two people wearing the same elegant GūsūLán clothes.

‘Two wolves in sheep’s clothing.’ This thought suddenly crossed Wèi WúXiàn’s mind. He wanted to laugh, but he couldn’t because of Lán WàngJī’s fast and vigorous movements.

However, it didn’t prevent him from thinking, “This doggy style is indeed like being eaten by a fierce beast.” Though, his elegant husband was still looking like his usual self.

Still, his jade colour-like face formed a contrast with his powerful back and forth motion. Only his burning eyes showed his passion.

Wèi WúXiàn kept on thinking, “Lán Zhàn has a hidden side that he lets only me see.”

Despite his waist being held tight, Wèi WúXiàn could sense Lán WàngJī’s feeling for him. “Lán Zhàn truly wants me. Since he is mine, I’ll give him everything he wants.”

Meanwhile, deeply and fiercely penetrated, Wèi WúXiàn’s hole was filled with Lán WàngJī’s huge stuff. His hole tightened on Lán WàngJī’s manhood as he constantly moved inside Wèi WúXiàn.

Wèi WúXiàn couldn’t help but keep on moaning for being extremely overwhelmed by the sexual climax.

“This is not actually Lán WàngJī’s favourite position,” thought Wèi WúXiàn. “With this position, he can’t see the pleasure that he gives written on my face or be able to kiss me.

“Fortunately, via this mirror, he can still capture all the hot expressions on my face.

“Also, having me dressed in the GūsūLán uniform with the forehead ribbon seems as though he has fulfilled a sweet dream.

“For the last few days, he has undergone extreme anxiety, worried that he would not find me, then worried that I have forgotten about us, worried that I’m no longer used to our physical intimacy, worried that he would fail to satisfy me.

“Then, he’s worried about my Golden Core, worried about my health.

“All these times, we have made love; Lán Zhàn has only one goal: to make me feel fully satisfied.

“Only this time, what he truly wants is to cast aside all his worries; he simply and purely wants me, nothing else but me.”
