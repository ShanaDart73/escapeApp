“HánGuāng-Jūn, am I not injured?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.

“By no means,” Lán WàngJī replied.

“Really? You did it so hard.”

“Then, let me have a look.” Lán WàngJī stopped moving and pulled out his manhood.

“What?!” cried Wèi WúXiàn. Then, he set himself free from Lán WàngJī’s arms, put some distance between them, and then, he added, “What do you mean by having a look? I was joking.”

Without saying anything, Lán WàngJī reached out for the black box and took out the same ointment as before.

Although he perfectly knew that he didn’t injure Wèi WúXiàn, especially since this night was his “first time”, still, he wanted to apply the salve on Wèi WúXiàn.

Back then, on their first day, Lán WàngJī felt a little bit bitter afterwards because he had injured Wèi WúXiàn due to his lack of experience; he didn’t know that he should have applied an ointment.

Therefore, this time, he didn’t want to make the same mistake.

Seeing what Lán WàngJī was holding in his hand, Wèi WúXiàn began to wonder, “Is it not the ointment? Why does he need it for?” Then, he realised, “Don’t tell me that he’s going to apply it there! No way! It’s so embarrassing.”

Wèi WúXiàn’s first reaction was to run away; however, he was rooted to the spot by Lán WàngJī’s glance.

“Wèi Yīng, you are not allowed to get out of bed,” said Lán WàngJī.

Then, he held Wèi WúXiàn’s ankles and gently pulled him back. And then, he put Wèi WúXiàn’s legs on his shoulders once more and raised his buttocks.

Wèi WúXiàn thought, “Earlier, he induced me to watch, and now, he coaxes me to let him have a look.”

However, this time, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t want to be subdued so easily.

“Lán Zhàn, I’m really fine. I don’t need that,” Wèi WúXiàn implored.

Lán WàngJī paid no heed to his demand. After raising Wèi WúXiàn's buttocks, he now used his fingers to probe the opening of the hole; then, he put two fingers inside and slightly spread the hole.

Everything was all right, and, with this posture, while applying the ointment, it would not leak out, thought Lán WàngJī.

Then, after taking some portion of the salve, he began gently to apply it on Wèi WúXiàn’s hole.

“Agh...” Wèi WúXiàn moaned. He could not help it, especially after being bumped so vigorously.

Lán WàngJī massaged the hole by making circular motions with his fingers, softly rubbing the inside, which still had his white fluid, and, moreover, it produced a clear sound as his fingers moved about the hole.

Becoming embarrassed by the erotic sound, Wèi WúXiàn began slightly to twist his hips so as to avoid Lán WàngJī’s touch.

The more Lán WàngJī excelled in his way of making him feel good, the more embarrassing it became for Wèi WúXiàn.

“Are you okay?” asked Lán WàngJī.

“Um, it feels a little bit cold,” he replied, then asked, “Lán Zhàn, can I do it myself?”

“No, you can’t.”

Although he didn’t plan on applying the ointment on Wèi WúXiàn, however, since it had crossed his mind, he might as well do it himself and do it properly for Wèi WúXiàn’s sake.

Back then, everything happened very fast, like dry woods catching fire, and, in an instant, everything turned into a blazing fire.

He was not mentally prepared for it and was caught by the fire of his own long-held-back desire and unleashed his passions that he could scarcely control.

He had frenetically moved inside Wèi WúXiàn, over and over, since, at that time, he had felt that it was not enough for him to stop, that his desire had not been quenched yet.

If only, back then, he had taken good care of him, he would not be injured.

Lán WàngJī withdrew his fingers to take some more ointment, then he applied it directly on Wèi WúXiàn’s sensitive area.

From now on, there would be other occasions to mend his past mistake. So, for now, Lán WàngJī didn’t want to be distracted by what happened back then; he only wanted to make Wèi WúXiàn feel happy and fully satisfied.

“Agh...” However, Wèi WúXiàn could not bear his touch, and his breath gradually became heavy, because, not long ago, he had had an orgasm, and, as a result, his whole body had become too sensitive to withstand an erotic massage. Naturally, his manhood began to react.

“Lán Zhàn, can you let me lie on my stomach?” he asked so that, in this position, Lán WàngJī would not notice his reaction.

“No, I can’t,” he replied and also noticed that Wèi WúXiàn was getting hard.

“At least, don’t raise my bottom so high.” Wèi WúXiàn was really embarrassed.

“That won’t do.” He stopped moving his fingers inside Wèi WúXiàn and went on, “This position allows me to see inside more clearly.”

Wèi WúXiàn then began to twist left and right.

In an earnest tone, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, this is just a mere application of the ointment.”

Then, he resumed his massage by skilfully drawing circles around Wèi WúXiàn’s weak area, which caused so much sexual arousal in Wèi WúXiàn that he began to tremble.

Wèi WúXiàn could not help but grab Lán WàngJī’s hand, and then he asked, “Lán Zhàn, are you not doing this on purpose?”

“Yes, I am.”

“What!?” Wèi WúXiàn didn’t expect Lán WàngJī to admit it so easily.

“Before, it was not. But now, I’m doing it deliberately.” At the instant he had seen Wèi WúXiàn’s little erection, Lán WàngJī had purposely begun to arouse him even more.

Then, he pressed hard on Wèi WúXiàn’s P-spot.

“Aaah... Lán Zhàn!” As expected, Wèi WúXiàn spasmed violently, and his manhood got harder.

“Come on, Lán Zhàn, stop fooling around. If you want to do it, then do it.”

For a brief instant, a faint smile seemed to have appeared on Lán WàngJī’s face. He pulled out his fingers, and, with the ointment slimily wrapped around his fingers, he applied it around the opening of the hole.

And then, once more, using his forehead ribbon that was still around the bedhead, Lán WàngJī tied Wèi WúXiàn’s wrists. This time, however, he firmly tied them before securing the ribbon on the bedhead.

“Wèi Yīng, the meaning of wearing GūsūLán’s forehead ribbon is to restrain oneself,” said Lán WàngJī in his deep voice that resounded inside Wèi WúXiàn’s ears.

He went on, “Only in the presence of a soulmate, the person you love, is there no need to restrain yourself.”

Lán WàngJī then leaned over Wèi WúXiàn and slightly bit his lower lip, then he said, “Wèi Yīng, I love you.” And then, he looked at him with tenderness. Meanwhile, Wèi WúXiàn’s heart was beating fast.

Then, Lán WàngJī earnestly said, “Wèi Yīng, you and I are a married couple.” His gaze was getting hotter, and Wèi WúXiàn felt as though he was floating in the air.

Not long ago, he was feeling really embarrassed, and now, it seemed to him that he was surrounded by beautiful scenery, just like in a fairyland. Wèi WúXiàn was so dumbfounded by what he just learned that he was unable to utter a single word.

Lán WàngJī felt a little bit disappointed. It seemed that this time he would not hear Wèi WúXiàn’s passionate confession.

However, for now, it did not matter, because the current Wèi WúXiàn didn’t have any painful past, nor did he have nightmares. Everything was perfect and harmonious, and, as long as Wèi WúXiàn was happy and satisfied, that was all that counted to Lán WàngJī.

He then kissed his lips, moved close to his ear and licked his earlobe, and then, he slightly sucked it.

Afterwards, he whispered to Wèi WúXiàn’s ear, “Wèi Yīng, I want you. Doing it only once is not enough.”

“Agh!” These whispers were enough to turn him on. And, as a response to Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn wrapped his legs around Lán WàngJī’s waist.

Lán WàngJī then resumed licking and sucking Wèi WúXiàn’s earlobe, then carried down to his neck, and softly bit Wèi WúXiàn’s Adam’s apple.

Meanwhile, he slid his hand between Wèi WúXiàn’s legs, then he inserted two fingers deeply inside his body. And, from his fingertips, Lán WàngJī released a thin stream of his spiritual power, which hit directly onto Wèi WúXiàn’s weak spot.

“Aaah... Agh... Lán Zhàn...” A sudden and intense pleasure travelled from his weak spot through his whole body, causing him to tremble uncontrollably.

In fact, using spiritual power there was forbidden.

Since he was always eager to try new techniques, Wèi WúXiàn had suggested it to Lán WàngJī. So, when the latter actually used it during their foreplay, Wèi WúXiàn found it too intense to bear. So, he wrote it to their Jingshi’s rules as a forbidden technique.

Lán WàngJī then looked at him, and, in a soothing voice, he said, “Wèi Yīng, leave everything to me.”

Then, he moved down between Wèi WúXiàn’s legs and took his already-upright manhood into his mouth.

While performing fellatio on Wèi WúXiàn, Lán WàngJī alternately released gentle and strong streams of the spiritual power through his two fingers, which were still inside Wèi WúXiàn, and kept on arousing Wèi WúXiàn’s sexual pleasure.

Lán WàngJī wanted to make Wèi WúXiàn’s “first time” be an exceptionally unforgettable experience.

He wanted him to savour every one of his moves inside him, to enjoy every pleasure that he gave him.

He wanted him to experience great climaxes, to cry when he penetrated deeply inside him, and to surrender to him completely.

He wanted him to feel him when he came inside him and blended with him body and soul.

“Lán Zhàn... Lán Zhàn...” With the stream of spiritual power hitting his P-spot and his manhood being sucked, and, from time to time, the head getting squeezed by the wall of Lán WàngJī’s throat, Wèi WúXiàn lost control and began to kick Lán WàngJī in the back.

“My darling...” Wèi WúXiàn unconsciously said the words that he usually used when he begged for mercy. Then, his whole body convulsed, and, at the same time, he released inside Lán WàngJī’s mouth.

Lán WàngJī swallowed his fluid, pulled out his fingers from Wèi WúXiàn’s hole, and, vigorously, he inserted his huge manhood deeply inside him.
