Lán WàngJī went to the wardrobe and took out two sets of green clothes.

Surprised, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Do we need to change our clothes?”

“In that festival, everyone wear green,” Lán WàngJī replied, “We’ve been there before, so we already have the green clothes.”

“All right,” said Wèi WúXiàn.

Then, he began to take off his clothes. However, halfway through, he felt that something was wrong. He cast a quick look at Lán WàngJī and saw that the latter was watching him. He suddenly felt embarrassed.

“You can go behind the dressing screen to change your clothes,” suggested Lán WàngJī.

With his face turned red, Wèi WúXiàn took his clothes, and quickly went behind the dressing screen.

Inwardly, he suddenly began to wonder, “This is really weird. We are both males, naturally, there is nothing wrong to be in the same room to change clothes. So, why do I have to be behind the dressing screen?”

He carried on thinking, “However, if the other person is none other than Lán Zhàn, somehow, it feels different.”

Wèi WúXiàn then looked through the dressing screen, and saw that Lán WàngJī was facing the dressing screen on the other side. And, it appeared that he had already taken off his outer garments.

Behind the dressing screen, Lán WàngJī’s silhouette appeared very tall, with broad shoulders and two firm and strong arms.

Wèi WúXiàn got a sudden desire to see how Lán WàngJī looked like without his outer robes.

However, he resisted and carried on changing clothes. And, when he finished, he came out and saw that Lán WàngJī had also finished dressing.

The garments were very beautiful, and the colour was dark green, similar to a pine tree’s. Wèi WúXiàn had never seen him wearing green clothes before.

He was so elegant, and, with his natural beauty, he was looking like a deity. Wèi WúXiàn could not help himself from blushing at his gorgeous appearance.

“Wèi Yīng, your cheeks seem slightly red. Are you feeling sick?” asked Lán WàngJī.

Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly replied, “I’m feeling fine.” Then, he put a hand on his face and thought, “Indeed, my face is burning hot.”

Lán WàngJī turned his head away, and a faint and furtive smile appeared on his face. However, his smile disappeared so quickly that Wèi WúXiàn thought that he saw it wrong.

“You have wrongly tied your waist-belt,” said Lán WàngJī.

He then got closer to Wèi WúXiàn, undid the waist-belt, then properly fastened it around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist, while a faint fragrance of sandalwood caressed Wèi WúXiàn’s nostrils.

As Lán WàngJī finished tying his waist-belt, Wèi WúXiàn carefully looked at it, but failed to see any difference from what he had done before.

However, he became aware of his own appearance; both of them were wearing the identical garments with the same embroidered motifs.

“Your hair are a little bit messy,” remarked Lán WàngJī.

Wèi WúXiàn quickly said, “I’ll tidy it myself.” Then, he hurried towards the dressing mirror.

Upon reaching it, Wèi WúXiàn was shocked by his own reflection in the mirror.

In a low voice, he said, “Lán Zhàn, Jiāng Chéng said that I once died. So, my current appearance once belonged to the person who summoned me.”

Lán WàngJī frowned when he heard the word ‘died’ from Wèi WúXiàn’s mouth.

“This face is indeed different from my formal one,” he said, then turned his head to look at Lán WàngJī, “It seems like I am not the only one here who has changed, you have also changed a lot.”

Lán WàngJī walked towards Wèi WúXiàn, then stood behind him. They looked at each other in the mirror.

In a deep voice, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you are still who you used to be, you definitely haven’t changed at all. As for, I haven’t changed either.”

After a pause, he asked, “Should we go there on our swords?”

Wèi WúXiàn hesitantly replied, “Yes.”

Lán WàngJī then fetched a cloak, and said, “Put this on.”

As was his habit, Wèi WúXiàn just stretched his arms so Lán WàngJī could do it for him. So, he did. Then, he carried on putting the hood over Wèi WúXiàn’s head, and secured it by tying the laces in a knot.

After a few moments, Wèi WúXiàn suddenly realised that he actually let Lán WàngJī put the cloak on him. Moreover, as they had stepped outside, he unconsciously held Lán WàngJī’s hand to get on Bìchén.

And, right now, he was standing behind Lán WàngJī, and his eyes were on his broad back. He didn’t know where else to direct his gaze, or where to put his hands.

“Hold me tight. We will be travelling against the wind,” said Lán WàngJī.

Inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn said, “In my entire life, I’ve never expected to hear the words ‘Hold me tight’ coming from Lán Zhàn’s mouth.”

As Lán WàngJī saw that he hadn’t hold him yet, he took Wèi WúXiàn’s both hands, and made him wrap his arms around his waist.

Wèi WúXiàn just gave up on thinking too much, and firmly held Lán WàngJī’s waist, then, Lán WàngJī set Bìchén in motion; they took off, flying high in the sky.

Wèi WúXiàn then began to wonder. “Does Lán Zhàn know that I can no longer, on my own, fly on the sword?”

Then, he thought again, “Wait a minute! This can’t be the case, because my current body used to belong to someone else, and his spiritual power is not great. That might explain why Lán Zhàn has taken me to drive on his sword.”

Wèi WúXiàn was lost in thought that he failed to admire the scenery as they flew by.

“Wèi Yīng, what are you thinking about?” asked Lán WàngJī.

“I’m not thinking,” he denied.

“We will soon fly across the Green Lake, then arrive in Caiyin Town,” said Lán WàngJī, then, he began to lower their altitude.

“Is it in that town that the festival is taking place?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.

“Yes,” he replied.

By the time they reached the lake, they were flying at an altitude of few metres above water. At this short distance, they could clearly admire the reflection of the sky gleaming on the surface of the lake, with some thin ripples here and there.

“Is this the Green Lake?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.

“Yes,” he replied.

“Are there water ghouls in this lake?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.

“No. They have been suppressed,” replied Lán WàngJī, “Two years ago, you have improved the properties of the spiritual nets. This improvement has made the nets be more efficient and convenient underwater, and helped to get rid of the water ghouls.”

“Wow! I really did that!” he exclaimed.

“Yes,” replied Lán WàngJī, then, he praised him, which made him feel happy.

So, Wèi WúXiàn began to talk about the ingenious ideas he had, then carried on narrating his prowess in hunting demons and monsters. Even though Lán WàngJī, from time to time, only replied in monosyllables, he just kept on talking.

Although he had already heard most of what Wèi WúXiàn was saying, Lán WàngJī just kept on listening. In fact, he never got tired of hearing Wèi WúXiàn speaking.

Wèi WúXiàn gradually hugged Lán WàngJī more and more tighter. When he got tired from talking too much, he put his head against Lán WàngJī’s back, and, progressively, fell asleep.

Reaching the town of Caiyin, Lán WàngJī drove his sword on the outskirts of the town, found a quiet place, then, he landed.

He then held Wèi WúXiàn in his arms, and inwardly said, “Indeed, he has fallen asleep.” However, he didn’t want to wake him up.

He chose a clean and large rock, sat down, and look at Wèi WúXiàn who was soundly sleeping in his arms.

Only up to now that Lán WàngJī felt a little bit at ease.

He was in agony for two days of the search, then he had to wait another two days for Wèi WúXiàn to wake up.

When he finally woke up, Lán WàngJī received a great shock, because Wèi WúXiàn had forgotten all about them living as a couple.

Moreover, Wèi WúXiàn even said that he wanted to go back to Lotus Piers, when Jiāng Chéng told him that they both had been living and doing everything together.

Luckily for Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn was still able to read his facial expression, and all his little habits had not changed. So, thankfully, he was still his Wèi Yīng.

Lán WàngJī slightly lifted Wèi WúXiàn’s chin, and deeply kissed him.

Being unconsciously familiar with Lán WàngJī’s touch and scent, Wèi WúXiàn parted his lips, and let Lán WàngJī’s tongue penetrate into his mouth.

Lán WàngJī kissed Wèi WúXiàn softly, savouring the sweetness and softness of his tongue. And, at the same, releasing all his anxiety and worries, all his panic and torment of these past four days.

Then, when he finished kissing him, Lán WàngJī slightly bit Wèi WúXiàn’s lower lip, and the latter let out a “hmm” sound, which set fire down in Lán WàngJī’s manhood.

“Lán Zhàn, you came back a bit earlier. Hurry up, hold me. I am yours.” Wèi WúXiàn once said that to him.

And, right now, he wanted to make love to him here, at this place, at this instant. He wanted to see his eyes gleaming with lust, and hear him moaning in pleasure. His urge of holding him was way too strong to bear.

Lán WàngJī took a deep breath, then, he pecked Wèi WúXiàn on the cheek and lips, and then, he put him on the rock, placed Wèi WúXiàn’s head on his lap, and began to meditate in order to calm himself down.

After a while, Wèi WúXiàn slowly opened his eyes. While he was sleeping, he had a strange dream. In his dream, Lán WàngJī and he were living in seclusion.

Both of them were on a boat, and Lán WàngJī, wearing a raincoat, cast a fishing net in the lake.

On their way back home, they let the current push the boat. Lán WàngJī sat on the bow of the boat, looking at Wèi WúXiàn who was playing some notes on Chénqíng.

As he finished recalling his dream, Wèi WúXiàn now looked at Lán WàngJī in green garments, and, with the one in a raincoat, in his dream, he saw in front of him the two images of Lán WàngJī overlapping each other.

He chuckled.

“What makes you chortle?” Lán WàngJī asked.

Wèi WúXiàn sat up, adjusted his robes, and failed to notice that his head was resting on Lán WàngJī’s lap, he replied, “I was just looking how handsome you are. I also dreamed of you.”

“Did you sleep well?” he asked.

Wèi WúXiàn noticed that the way Lán WàngJī looked at him was slightly different than before. He got puzzled.

However, he simply replied, “I slept well.”Tthen he realised, “It’s strange that I easily fell asleep. Didn’t you say that I was in a coma for few days?”

“You usually don’t wake up so early in the morning,” he replied.

“Let’s go to the town,” Lán WàngJī went on, “What do you want to eat?”

“We’ve already arrived. What is this place?” he asked.

“This is Cross-Path Village,” Lán WàngJī replied.

“What an interesting name,” Wèi WúXiàn remarked.
