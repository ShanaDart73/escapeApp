Lán WàngJī went to the wardrobe and took out two sets of green clothes.

Surprised, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Do we need to change our clothes?”

“In that festival, everyone wears green,” Lán WàngJī replied. “We’ve been there before, so we already have the green clothes.”

“All right,” said Wèi WúXiàn.

Then, he began to take off his clothes. However, halfway through, he felt that something was wrong. He cast a quick look at Lán WàngJī and saw that the latter was watching him. He suddenly felt embarrassed.

“You can go behind the dressing screen to change your clothes,” suggested Lán WàngJī.

With his face turned red, Wèi WúXiàn took his clothes and quickly went behind the dressing screen.

Inwardly, he suddenly began to wonder, “This is really weird. We are both males; naturally, there is nothing wrong with being in the same room to change clothes. So, why do I have to go behind the dressing screen?”

He carried on thinking, “However, if the other person is none other than Lán Zhàn, somehow, it feels different.”

Wèi WúXiàn then glanced via the dressing screen and saw Lán WàngJī's silhouette facing the dressing screen on the other side. And it appeared that he had already taken off his outer garments.

Behind the dressing screen, Lán WàngJī’s silhouette appeared very tall, with broad shoulders and two firm and strong arms.

Wèi WúXiàn got a sudden desire to see what Lán WàngJī looked like without his outer robes.

However, he resisted and carried on changing clothes. And, when he finished, he came out and saw that Lán WàngJī had also finished dressing.

The garments were exquisite; the colour was dark green, similar to a pine tree’s. Wèi WúXiàn had never seen him wearing green clothes before.

He was so elegant, and, with his natural beauty, he looked like a deity. Wèi WúXiàn could not help himself from blushing at his gorgeous appearance.

“Wèi Yīng, your cheeks seem slightly red. Are you feeling sick?” asked Lán WàngJī.

Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly replied, “I’m feeling fine.” Then, he put a hand on his face and thought, “Indeed, my face feels like it's on fire.”

Lán WàngJī turned his head away, and a faint and furtive smile appeared on his face. However, his smile disappeared so quickly that Wèi WúXiàn thought that he saw it wrong.

“You have wrongly tied your waist-belt,” said Lán WàngJī.

He then got closer to Wèi WúXiàn, undid the waist-belt, and then properly fastened it around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist, while a faint fragrance of sandalwood caressed Wèi WúXiàn’s nostrils.

As Lán WàngJī finished tying his waist-belt, Wèi WúXiàn carefully looked at it but failed to see any difference from what he had done before.

However, he became aware of his appearance; both of them were wearing the identical garments with the same embroidered motifs.

“Your hair is a little bit messy,” remarked Lán WàngJī.

Wèi WúXiàn quickly said, “I’ll tidy it myself.” Then, he hurried towards the dressing mirror.

Upon reaching it, Wèi WúXiàn was shocked by his reflection in the mirror.

In a low voice, he said, “Lán Zhàn, Jiāng Chéng said that I once died. So, my current appearance once belonged to the person who summoned me.”

Lán WàngJī frowned when he heard Wèi WúXiàn say the word died.

“This face is indeed different from my formal one,” he said, then turned his head to look at Lán WàngJī. “It seems like I am not the only one here who has changed; you have also changed a lot.”

Lán WàngJī walked towards Wèi WúXiàn, then stood behind him. They looked at each other in the mirror.

In a deep voice, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you are still who you used to be; you definitely haven’t changed at all. As for me, I haven’t changed either.”

After a pause, he asked, “Should we go there on our swords?”

Wèi WúXiàn hesitantly replied, “Yes.”

Lán WàngJī then fetched a cloak and said, “Put this on.”

As was his habit, Wèi WúXiàn just stretched his arms so Lán WàngJī could do it for him. So, he did. Then, he carried on putting the hood over Wèi WúXiàn’s head and secured it by tying the laces in a knot.

A moment later, Wèi WúXiàn came to the realisation that Lán WàngJī had put the cloak on him, and that, at the time, it hadn't seemed strange at all. Moreover, as they had stepped outside, he unconsciously held Lán WàngJī’s hand to get on Bìchén.

And, right now, he was standing behind Lán WàngJī, and his eyes were on his broad back. He didn’t know where else to direct his gaze or where to put his hands.

“Hold me tight. We'll be flying against the wind,” said Lán WàngJī.

Wèi WúXiàn thought, “In all my life, I never expected to hear Lán Zhàn say, ‘Hold me tight.’”

As Lán WàngJī saw that he hadn’t held him yet, he took Wèi WúXiàn’s hands and made him wrap his arms around his waist.

Wèi WúXiàn decided not to think too much and firmly held his waist. Lán WàngJī then set Bìchén in motion. They took off and flew high in the sky.

Wèi WúXiàn then thought, “Does Lán Zhàn know that I can't fly on the sword any longer?”

Then, he thought again, “Wait a minute! This can’t be the case. My current body used to belong to someone else, and his spiritual power is not great. That might explain why Lán Zhàn takes me to drive on his sword.”

Wèi WúXiàn was so lost in thought that he failed to admire the scenery as they flew by.

“Wèi Yīng, what are you thinking about?” asked Lán WàngJī.

“I’m not thinking,” he denied.

“We will soon fly across the Green Lake and then arrive in Caiyin Town,” said Lán WàngJī, and then he began to lower their altitude.

“Is it in that town that the festival is taking place?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.

“Yes,” he replied.

By the time they reached the lake, they were flying at an altitude of a few metres above water. At this short distance, they could clearly admire the reflection of the sky gleaming on the surface of the lake, with some thin ripples here and there.

“Is this the Green Lake?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.

“Yes,” he replied.

“Are there water ghouls in this lake?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.

“No. They have been suppressed,” replied Lán WàngJī. “Two years ago, you improved the properties of the spiritual nets. This improvement has made the nets more effective and helped get rid of the water ghouls.”

“Wow! I really did that!” he exclaimed.

“Yes,” replied Lán WàngJī, and then he praised him, which made him feel happy.

So, Wèi WúXiàn began to talk about the ingenious ideas he had, then carried on narrating his prowess in hunting demons and monsters. Even though Lán WàngJī, from time to time, only replied in monosyllables, he just kept on talking.

Although he had already heard most of what Wèi WúXiàn was saying, Lán WàngJī just kept on listening. In fact, he never got tired of hearing Wèi WúXiàn speaking.

Wèi WúXiàn gradually hugged Lán WàngJī tighter. When he got exhausted from talking too much, he put his head against Lán WàngJī’s back and, progressively, fell asleep.

Reaching the town of Caiyin, Lán WàngJī drove his sword on the outskirts of the town, found a quiet place, and then landed.

He then held Wèi WúXiàn in his arms and inwardly said, “Indeed, he has fallen asleep.” However, he didn’t want to wake him up.

He chose a clean and large rock, sat down, and looked at Wèi WúXiàn, who was soundly sleeping in his arms.

Only now did Lán WàngJī feel a little bit at ease.

He was in agony for two days of the search, then he had to wait another two days for Wèi WúXiàn to wake up.

When he finally woke up, Lán WàngJī received a great shock, because Wèi WúXiàn had forgotten all about them living as a couple.

Moreover, Wèi WúXiàn even said that he wanted to go back to Lotus Piers, when Jiāng Chéng told him that they both had been living and doing everything together.

Luckily for Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn was still able to read his facial expression, and all his little habits had not changed. So, thankfully, he was still his Wèi Yīng.

Lán WàngJī slightly lifted Wèi WúXiàn’s chin and deeply kissed him.

As he was unconsciously familiar with Lán WàngJī’s touch and scent, Wèi WúXiàn parted his lips and let Lán WàngJī’s tongue penetrate into his mouth.

Lán WàngJī softly kissed Wèi WúXiàn, savouring the sweetness and softness of his tongue. At the same time, all his worries, as well as the panic and torment he had felt over the past four days, were gradually fading away.

As he finished kissing him, Lán WàngJī slightly bit Wèi WúXiàn’s lower lip, and the latter let out a “hmm” sound, which set fire down in Lán WàngJī’s manhood.

“Lán Zhàn, you came back a bit earlier. Hurry up, hold me. I am yours.” Wèi WúXiàn once said that to him.

And, right now, he wanted to make love to him here, at this place, at this instant. He wanted to see his eyes gleaming with lust and hear him moaning in pleasure. His urge to hold him was way too strong to bear.

Lán WàngJī took a deep breath. He then pecked Wèi WúXiàn on the cheek and lips and then laid him on the rock, placing Wèi WúXiàn’s head on his lap, and he began to meditate to calm himself down.

After a while, Wèi WúXiàn slowly opened his eyes. While he was sleeping, he had a strange dream. In his dream, Lán WàngJī and he were living in seclusion.

Both of them were on a boat, and Lán WàngJī, wearing a raincoat, cast a fishing net in the lake.

On their way back home, they let the current push the boat. Lán WàngJī sat on the bow of the boat, looking at Wèi WúXiàn, who was playing some notes on Chénqíng.

As he finished recalling his dream, Wèi WúXiàn now looked at Lán WàngJī in green garments, and, with the one in a raincoat, in his dream, he saw in front of him the two images of Lán WàngJī overlapping each other.

He chuckled.

“What makes you chortle?” Lán WàngJī asked.

Wèi WúXiàn sat up, adjusted his robes, and failed to notice that his head was resting on Lán WàngJī’s lap. He replied, “I was just looking at how handsome you are. I also dreamed of you.”

“Did you sleep well?” he asked.

Wèi WúXiàn noticed that the way Lán WàngJī looked at him was slightly different than before. He got puzzled.

However, he simply replied, “I slept well.” Suddenly, he exclaimed, “It’s strange that I easily fell asleep. Didn’t you say that I was in a coma for a few days?”

“You usually don’t wake up so early in the morning,” he replied.

“Let’s go to the town.” Lán WàngJī went on, “What do you want to eat?”

“We’ve already arrived. What is this place?” he asked.

“This is Cross-Path Village,” Lán WàngJī replied.

“What an amusing name,” Wèi WúXiàn remarked.
