Wèi WúXiàn smiled, then said, “So, you came here for me, waiting until I woke up. As for me, I had prepared a present for you. In other words, you and I have a good relationship.”

“What about your mother?” Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Where is she? Is she all right?”

Instantly, a dead silence fell into the room.

However, before Lán WàngJī could step in, Jīn Líng had already collected himself, and, like a shooting star, he replied, “She has gone to the eastern regions along with father.

“Since you wanted absolutely to protect the last Wēn clan, mother wanted to protect you. Therefore, father decided to send them to the eastern regions, where he found a new place for them to settle.

“From time to time, mother and father go there to pay them a visit on your behalf.”

“A few years ago, father was tired of whole clan’s affairs,” Jīn Líng went on, “He wanted to spend more time with mother, so he designated me to become the leader our clan, then, along with mother, they have set off on journey, sightseeing the eastern regions.”

Out of the blue, Jīn Líng said all those lies, causing Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí to be so dumbfounded that they didn’t even dare to move a muscle.

“Is Jīn ZiXuān* that amazing?” Wèi WúXiàn seemed to talk to himself rather asking. Then, after a short pause of thinking, he added, “That’s right! Occasionally, he shows some courage.”

<small>*Jīn ZiXuān is Jīn Líng’s father.</small>

He then asked, “Lán Zhàn, is what Jīn Líng said true?”

Anxious, Jīn Líng clenched his fists tight, waiting to see if Lán WàngJī would cooperate or not. Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí were also nervous.

In a deep voice, Lán WàngJī replied, “Yes.”

Then, Wèi WúXiàn quickly asked, “Then, what about me? Since the last Wēn clan left for eastern regions, what has become of me?”

Cocksure, Jīn Líng replied, “You have joined our LánlíngJīn sect and become my underling.”

Lán WàngJī glanced at Jīn Líng, and the latter, feeling embarrassed, lowered his head.

Wèi WúXiàn observed Lán WàngJī’s expression, and, with a smile on his face, he said, “That was a lie. However, according to what you said before, I’ve probably rejoined the YúnmèngJiāng sect.”

While he carried on eating, Wèi WúXiàn said, “This congee is really tasty. Some fish has been added into it. What kind of fish is it?”

“It’s dace fillets,” replied Lán WàngJī.

Wèi WúXiàn said, “It’s so tender and delicious. Has this dish always been part of GūsūLán cooking?”

Then, suddenly something crossed his mind, he said, “Eh! Lán Zhàn, you haven't said 'Don't speak while eating' yet!”

Jīn Líng spoke before Lán WàngJī could reply, “Hey! If you can walk, let’s go to the Elegant Room after you finish eating. My uncle is there. He has been waiting for you to wake up.”

Wèi WúXiàn said, “Your uncle? Oh, you mean Jiāng Chéng.”, then he realised, “Wait a minute! Why did you use ‘hey’ to call me, while you called Jiāng Chéng ‘uncle’? Am I not also your uncle?”

Lán WàngJī cast a look at Jīn Líng.

Jīn Líng reluctantly said, “All right! I’ll call you ‘uncle Wèi’, and keep calling him ‘uncle’.”

Wèi WúXiàn said, “It sounds like you are more closer to Jiāng Chéng than me. A-Líng*, I had made a powerful charm just for you. Why don’t you also form a strong attachment to me?”

<small>*A in A-Líng is prefix used before the “first name”, it indicates a close relationship. (It’s pronounced like the letter ‘a’ in the word ‘cat’.)</small>

“Uncle gave me a spiritual dog.” replied Jīn Líng.

Wèi WúXiàn said, “A spiritual dog.”

“That’s right!” said Jīn Líng, “I’ve already had a male spiritual dog. Uncle said that I could mate it with another dog, so he gave me a female spiritual dog.”

Jīn Líng carried on, “Maybe, next year, I will have a litter of puppies.”

Wèi WúXiàn hopelessly said, “All right! There’s no need to compare the gift that Jiāng Chéng gave you with mine.”

“Wèi Yīng, wait before going to the Elegant Room. I’m going to send someone to bring the baby girl here,” said Lán WàngJī.

Wèi WúXiàn replied, “Okay.”

Then, Lán WàngJī signed to Lán JǐngYí and Jīn Líng to follow him outside.

As they three left the room, Wèi WúXiàn began to chat with Lán SīZhuī, while eating his bowl of congee.

In the meantime, as they reached the gate of Jingshi courtyard, Lán WàngJī said to Lán JǐngYí not to tell anyone about Wèi WúXiàn’s amnesia, then sent him to the convent.

He then waited until Lán JǐngYí was out of earshot, and then asked Jīn Líng, “How did you come up with that made-up story?”

Lowering his head, Jīn Líng replied, “For the past few years, I have been thinking that if, that day, uncle Yáo* had succeeded in escaping to eastern regions that would be good.”

<small>*Jīn Líng refers to his father’s brother, Jīn GuāngYáo, who failed to get away from his countless crimes.</small>

Jīn Líng cast a quick look at Lán WàngJī, and, as he noticed that the latter was not displeased with what he just said, he carried on, “Last year, on my birthday banquet, Wèi WúXiàn and you told me that my parents were the most kind-hearted people, that my father was wonderful and reliable person.

“That night of my birthday, I dreamt of my father. In my dream, father saved SīZhuī, he also saved Wèi WúXiàn and mother. Many other people were also saved by him. In that dream, my father became a great hero.

“Ever since, I have that dream going on and on in my head. So, earlier, somehow, all those words spontaneously came out of my mouth.”

Then, he hesitantly asked, “Will..., will he be able to recover his memories?”

“I don’t know,” replied Lán WàngJī.

“Is it not a good thing that he doesn’t remember all those painful memories?” remarked Jīn Líng.

Lán WàngJī said, “One must face the facts, even though those facts are hard to surmount.” then, he added, “Go ahead to the Elegant Room, and inform Leader Jiāng about the current state of Wèi Yīng.”

“All right,” said Jīn Líng, “I’ll also tell him to keep it secret.” 

<br />&nbsp;
... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

An irregular yet charming mountain landscape, which, throughout the year, was surrounded by the white clouds, was the spectacular view offered by the GūsūLán residence. Being part of it was like living in a fairyland.

The early-morning mist had not cleared yet, and, with the exception of the chimes, the surroundings was still and quiet, making one feel completely at ease.

Even though the place was not a Buddhist temple, still it had the serenity of one.

On their way to the Elegant Room, Wèi WúXiàn remarked, “Lán Zhàn, Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù has not changed at all.”

“Uh,” agreed Lán WàngJī.

With his memories lost, the amnesia Wèi WúXiàn was happy to see Jīn Líng at last.

Also, it was a weight off his shoulders learning that the last Wēn clan was safe and sound. He felt relieved and more relaxed, as though he was rescued from a shipwreck.

A short time ago, he saw the little baby girl. Although he still didn’t remember anything, but just looking at the baby, who was sleeping soundly, with tints of pink on her cheeks, and whom he saved as he learned, made him extremely happy.

He also saw the doctor, who examined him for a while in an attempt to find the cause of his amnesia but failed.

By nature, Wèi WúXiàn had always been easy-going. Right now, he had a carefree attitude, feeling restful, and easily accepting that twenty years had passed, in which he had no recollections of it. He just cheerfully went with the flow.

“Lán Zhàn, have you found the parents of that little baby?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.

“I haven’t,” replied Lán WàngJī, “I asked everyone from Wěishàn Village, they all answered that none of their children are missing.”

“Oh! In other words, she was abandoned,” said Wèi WúXiàn, “This is so pitiful. When I was a child, and before uncle Jiāng found me, I also was all alone, not because I was abandoned, it was because my parents had passed away.”

He then asked, “Lán Zhàn, will GūsūLán carry on looking after her?”

“Of course,” Lán WàngJī replied.

“To have been given the opportunity to grow up at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù was a blessing,” thought Wèi WúXiàn. Deep down, he appreciated GūsūLán’s kindness towards the little baby.

When he started to live at Lotus Piers, Wèi WúXiàn grew up among many young brothers and a big sister. So, being an orphan did not affected his childhood at all.

He was sure that the baby would grow up happily among GūsūLán disciples. There was no need to worry about it.

He then asked, “Has GūsūLán given her a name?”

Lán WàngJī replied, “Not yet.”

“In that case, I’ll give her a nickname,” said Wèi WúXiàn, “After all, I was the one who saved her. Everyone can call her by her nickname.”

“All right,” said Lán WàngJī.

“Since she has a round and reddish face, I’ll name her Little Apple*,” said Wèi WúXiàn.

<small>*Little Apple is the name Wèi WúXiàn gives to his donkey in the original story.</small>

At the instant the words ‘Little Apple’ reached his ears, Lán WàngJī stopped abruptly, as if he was struck by lightning.

Observing Lán WàngJī’s reaction, Wèi WúXiàn said, “You don’t like it? It’s just a nickname. If we call her ‘little angel’ or ‘little baby’, I’m afraid that every little child would think that they have been called. While ‘Little Apple’ is more specific.”

Collecting himself, Lán WàngJī replied, “It’s perfect.”

“Lán Zhàn, after twenty years, your personality becomes more gentle. You even said ‘perfect’ to my suggestion. As far as I can remember you’ve never praised me before,” remarked Wèi WúXiàn.

He then went on, “I was washed away by the flood. Was it you who found me?”

Lán WàngJī replied, “It was Niè HuáiSāng who found you. He then notified me.”

Confused, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Why did he notify you instead of Jiāng Chéng?”

Ignoring Wèi WúXiàn’s question, Lán WàngJī asked, “Wèi Yīng, do you feel any discomfort anywhere in your body?”

The sudden change of the topic puzzled Wèi WúXiàn. However, he did not insist on the matter, he simply replied, “Not at all. I had a headache when I woke up. However, right now, I’m feeling completely fine.”

Lán WàngJī said, “According to what the doctor said, your amnesia is temporary, that you will soon recover your memories.”

With a complete trust in Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn said, “All right, then. I won’t ask any more questions. I’ll wait until I regain all my lost memories. And when that time comes, everything that I don’t understand now will become clear to me.”

“We arrived at Elegant Room,” said Lán WàngJī.

Raising his head, Wèi WúXiàn saw the ‘Elegant Room’ characters written on the top of the entrance. However, he seemed to hesitate to enter the room.

After they had pretended to severe their relationship, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t know if he was currently on good or bad terms with Jiāng Chéng.

Earlier, he found it awkward to inquire about it in front of Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí. Unfortunately, Jīn Líng left before he could find the opportunity to told to him alone.

Noticing Wèi WúXiàn’s hesitation, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, your relationship with Jiāng WǎnYín* has already improved considerably.”

<small>*Jiāng WǎnYín is Jiāng Chéng’s given name.</small>

“The issue of the last Wēn clan has already been solved,” thoughy Wèi WúXiàn, “So, that probably means that Jiāng Chéng and I have been reconciled with each other.”

He carried on thinking, “To think that Lán Zhàn is so good at observing people really surprised me. He actually knew that I was thinking.”
