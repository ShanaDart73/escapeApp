When they stepped into the Elegant Room, Lán XīChén, Jiāng Chéng and Jīn Líng were waiting for them.

Lán WàngJī glanced at Jīn Líng, and the latter nodded to him, signalling that he had already told the other two about Wèi WúXiàn’s amnesia.

Being by nature very kind and gentle, Lán XīChén was wearing a warm smile on his face. His smile, however, was less bright compared to the smile of Wèi WúXiàn.

Jiāng Chéng was just like in Wèi WúXiàn’s old memories, with thin eyebrows and almond-shaped eyes and a fierce and penetrating look on his face. When he saw Wèi WúXiàn coming in, his facial expression changed, a change that was hard to describe.

In a pleasant and friendly tone, Lán XīChén said, “WàngJī and WúXiàn, here you are.”

Wèi WúXiàn bowed and thought, “Just now, Zéwú-Jūn called me ‘WúXiàn’ instead of ‘Wèi-gōngzǐ’*. Do we already have such a close familiarity?”

<small>*gōngzǐ is an honorific title. The suffix is formal compared to ‘xiōng’ in ‘Wèi-xiōng’, which is informal.</small>

“Have you seen a doctor?” asked Jiāng Chéng.

Before Wèi WúXiàn could reply, Lán WàngJī spoke, “He is in good health condition. However, the cause of his amnesia is known. Anyway, the doctor said that he will recover his memories shortly.”

Jiāng Chéng knew that, for Wèi WúXiàn’s sake, Lán WàngJī would certainly request the best doctor. So, there was no need for him to worry about it.

Wèi WúXiàn said, “It doesn’t really matter that I have lost my memories, because I’m still alive and well. So, for the time being, you can tell me, little by little, what happened during these twenty years.”

“My old boy, are you taking twenty years for a few days?” remarked Jiāng Chéng.

He was aware that, once more, Wèi WúXiàn had lost his Golden Core and was very upset about it.

Wèi WúXiàn said, “Right now, I’m lacking twenty years of memories. Therefore, compared to all of you, I am twenty years younger than you. So, yes, indeed, I can take twenty years for a few days.”

While smiling, Lán XīChén said, “WúXiàn has always been philosophical. That’s great!” Then, he turned towards Lán WàngJī and said, “WàngJī, you no longer need to worry about it.”

With a bright smile on his face, Wèi WúXiàn wondered, “What is he worried about? Oh! I’ve got it!”

Then, he asked, “Lán Zhàn, are you worried about me?”

Lán WàngJī cast a glance at his elder brother for help. However, Lán XīChén remained silent while he kept smiling.

Pushed into the corner, Lán WàngJī replied, “Yes.”

“Yes, what?” Wèi WúXiàn playfully teased him.

“I’m worried about you,” said Lán WàngJī.

Dumbfounded, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t really expect to hear Lán WàngJī utter those words.

Jiāng Chéng stared open-mouthed at the scene that was playing in front of him. He then exchanged glances with Jīn Líng and then rolled his eyes.

Earlier, Jīn Líng stealthily told his uncle that he wanted to take Wèi WúXiàn with him back to Jīnlíntái, making Wèi WúXiàn a member of his LánlíngJīn clan.

Jiāng Chéng told him that there was no way Lán WàngJī would let go of Wèi WúXiàn. He also added that, whether he had lost his memories or not, Wèi WúXiàn would choose to stay with Lán WàngJī.

Meanwhile, Lán XīChén brought a flute and a sword and said to Wèi WúXiàn, “Suíbiàn is intact; however, since Chénqíng was underwater for twenty-four hours, I have carried out a check to make sure that it’s fine.”

He then added, “WúXiàn, since you woke up, I give them back to you.”

Wèi WúXiàn was somewhat puzzled, wondering why Lán XīChén would take care of his flute and sword. Nevertheless, he respectfully took Suíbiàn and Chénqíng and said, “Thank you very much, Zéwú-Jūn.”

“It was WàngJī who found them,” said Lán XīChén.

Wèi WúXiàn only said, “Oh!”

He unconsciously did not express his gratitude towards Lán WàngJī, since they both have already agreed that, between them, there was no need for it. He then hung his sword and flute on his waist-belt.

“Lán Zhàn, did you specially go there to look for them?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.

“I wasn’t only looking for them. I was also searching for you,” replied Lán WàngJī.

Wèi WúXiàn said, “Wow! Apparently, you have been really concerned about me.” Then he added, “Lán Zhàn, you have become more honest now.”

Since they were teenagers, Jiāng Chéng knew how Wèi WúXiàn enjoyed teasing Lán WàngJī. Right now, observing Wèi WúXiàn’s mood brought Jiāng Chéng back to those old days.

Furthermore, as Jiāng Chéng watched Wèi WúXiàn, who started again to tease Lán WàngJī, the images of the two back then and the present scene in front of him overlapped each other.

All of a sudden, he said, “Wèi WúXiàn, I want to talk to you in private.” having no desire to waste time.

In an instant, the smile on Wèi WúXiàn’s face froze, Jīn Líng became nervous, and Lán XīChén put his hand on Lán WàngJī’s shoulder by way of soothing him.

Jiāng Chéng and Wèi WúXiàn left the Elegant Room and walked until they arrived at a pavilion located next to the mountain path.

From the pavilion, there was a beautiful view of an array of trees at the base of the mountains. Nearby, wildflowers released their delicate fragrance that spread around the pavilion.

However, the two people inside the pavilion, having their minds full of concerns, failed to appreciate the beauty of their surroundings.

Earlier, in Jingshi, because he was not familiar with Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí, Wèi WúXiàn, despite having many questions to ask, decided to wait until he got the opportunity for it.

And, right now, he had the opportunity and opted for a topic which was less sensitive.

“Jiāng Chéng, why was I washed away by the flood?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.

Jiāng Chéng replied, “After the dragon, which was hidden deep in a pond, flew away, a torrential rain began to pour down. This heavy rain caused flash floods that inundated many downstream locations.

“You went to Ankang River, and, using your demonic power, you built a barrier that held the flow of water back. However, when the barrier collapsed, you were carried by the turbulent river.”

“Wow! I’m quite heroic,” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn.

And Jiāng Chéng rolled his eyes.

Then, Wèi WúXiàn was deep in thought. “I actually went to Ankang River to build a barrier. And Ankang is located close to the upper reaches of the Han River. And the Han River flows across the whole territory of Yúnmèng.

“In other words, I was in charge of handling Yúnmèng issues. That means that Jiāng Chéng really trusted me to tackle those issues.”

Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Right now, what is the situation of the flooded areas?”

Jiāng Chéng replied, “Fortunately, the heavy rain only lasted twenty-four hours. After that, the sky cleared up.

“The upper reaches of the Han River’s issues were successfully handled by Lán WàngJī together with you. As for the lower reaches, safety precautions have been taken in advance.

“In the end, it was more frightened than hurt.”

Surprised, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Did I go there along with Lán Zhàn?”

Jiāng Chéng looked disgustingly at him while grinding his teeth. Then he replied, “Yes.”

“So, that means that we both get along perfectly fine then,” remarked Wèi WúXiàn.

With a sneer, Jiāng Chéng said, “You both get along better than you think.” Then, he inwardly said, “You two got married, and your surname becomes ‘Lán Wèi’.”

With a smile on his face, Wèi WúXiàn said, “You didn’t believe me when I said that he definitely likes me.”

Jiāng Chéng was lost for words. Back then, he strongly believed that Lán WàngJī hated Wèi WúXiàn.

Wèi WúXiàn then said, “Usually, water ghouls emerge after a flood. As the leader, should you not be there, preventing those water ghouls from harming people?”

Jiāng Chéng replied, “Because someone went into a coma, so, to check on him, I had to fly on my sword to get here after patrolling the whole area. And, by chance, today, that person finally happened to wake up.”

Listening to Jiāng Chéng’s words warmed Wèi WúXiàn’s heart; he said, “Sect Leader Jiāng is a high-minded gentleman. Thank you for the hard work.”

In his friendly disposition, Wèi WúXiàn put his arm around Jiāng Chéng’s shoulders and gave him a little punch to the stomach. Just like when they were teenagers.

Since he didn’t expect to see Wèi WúXiàn behaving in this way towards him, Jiāng Chéng was stunned. He then quickly regained his composure and punched back.

Having passed through so many years of hardship, which had devastated their happy memories of when they used to put their arms around each other's shoulders, now, finally, all those bad days were swept away by the howling gale.

With the mountain breeze blowing on his face, Jiāng Chéng remained silent.

Still having his arm around Jiāng Chéng’s shoulders, Wèi WúXiàn noticed the change in Jiāng Chéng’s mood. However, he did not remove his arm around his shoulders. Jiāng Chéng, on the other hand, did not push him away either.

After a while, Jiāng Chéng asked, “Don’t you have something you want to tell me?”

“I am the one here who has lost his memories. Shouldn’t it be you who has a lot to tell me?” said Wèi WúXiàn.

Noticing that Jiāng Chéng’s expression had suddenly changed, Wèi WúXiàn had second thoughts. He thought, “For things I still want to know, I think I’d better ask Lán Zhàn later on rather than asking Jiāng Chéng.”

Jiāng Chéng said, “Don’t you think that things which were concealed would not be revealed during all these twenty years?”

Puzzled, Wèi WúXiàn removed his arm from around Jiāng Chéng’s shoulders, and, by joking, he said, “I think you have got taller than me. It becomes a little bit hard for me to put my arm around your shoulders.”

Inwardly, Jiāng Chéng said, “That’s because your former physical appearance has been substituted with a shorter one.”

Then, aloud, he said, “Don’t change the subject.”

Wèi WúXiàn remained silent for a while, then said, “I don’t know what you are referring to.”

“Oh, really?” retorted Jiāng Chéng. Then he said, “Give me your sword.”

“Suíbiàn?!” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn. “Why do you want it for?”

“Lend it to me,” insisted Jiāng Chéng.

Wèi WúXiàn took off Suíbiàn from his waist-belt and handed it to Jiāng Chéng.

While taking the sword, Jiāng Chéng was thinking of the fact that Wèi WúXiàn had formed a new Golden Core; however, because of Yúnmèng flash floods, his Golden Core was shattered into pieces. He was very upset and didn’t know who to blame for it.

Then, he tried to pull out the sword but couldn’t unsheathe Suíbiàn.

Using his spiritual power, Jiāng Chéng tried again to draw Suíbiàn. However, he was still unable to pull it out.

All of a sudden, Jiāng Chéng annoyingly burst into laughter. Then, without turning his head, he called out loudly, “HánGuāng-Jūn, where are you?”

Wèi WúXiàn turned his head and looked, but he didn’t see anyone.

“Lán WàngJī is definitely nearby. Call him to come over here,” said Jiāng Chéng.

Wèi WúXiàn could not make heads or tails of what Jiāng Chéng was up to. Nevertheless, turning towards the mountain path, he called out, “Lán Zhàn, are you around? Can you come over here?”

Soon after, Lán WàngJī came out from the grove at the foot of the mountain and walked up slowly.

Indeed, he was close by, choosing a spot in which he would not be within earshot. However, since he was somehow connected to Wèi WúXiàn, he was able to hear Wèi WúXiàn calling him.

Intuitively, Jiāng Chéng sensed that something was off. With a sneer, he pointed Suíbiàn towards Lán WàngJī and said, “Pull it out.”

Lán WàngJī had already understood the meaning behind Jiāng Chéng’s actions. He took Suíbiàn and slowly began to pull it out. Instantly, as Lán WàngJī progressively drew Suíbiàn* from its sheath, the reflection of light on the surface of the sword blade shone brightly.

<small>*Suíbiàn sealed itself after Wèi WúXiàn’s death. However, apart from Wèi WúXiàn, Jiāng Chéng was the only one to draw Suíbiàn, because, in the years prior to his death, when Jiāng Chéng’s Golden Core had been melted, Wèi WúXiàn secretly gave him his own Golden Core.</small>

Jiāng Chéng exclaimed, “What’s the meaning of this?”

Still in the dark, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “What on earth are you both playing at?”

Then Jiāng Chéng stormed, “Wèi WúXiàn, don’t you want to know where you have been and what you have been doing during all these years?”

Both Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn looked nervously at Jiāng Chéng.
