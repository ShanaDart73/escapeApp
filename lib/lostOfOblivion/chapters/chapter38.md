Wèi WúXiàn had already become horny; he slid his hands beneath Lán WàngJī’s clothes and began to fondle Lán WàngJī’s upper body.

“Wèi Yīng, wait a minute,” Lán WàngJī hurriedly said.

While trying to remove Lán WàngJī’s top clothes, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Why should I wait?”

“Because I have another gift for you,” replied Lán WàngJī.

The revelation of another gift seemed to surprise Wèi WúXiàn a little bit. And, every time Lán WàngJī wanted to give him a present, he would try hard to behave. So, he tidied up Lán WàngJī’s clothes.

He then asked, "Why are you holding me in such an ambiguous way when you are not in a hurry to take me to the bed?"

“Am I not allowed to carry you like this?” retorted Lán WàngJī.

Then, while still holding Wèi WúXiàn in his arms, Lán WàngJī walked to the bookshelf and stopped where a gorgeous blue brocade box with cloud motifs was.

Wèi WúXiàn opened the box and saw several volumes inside. He took out one volume while noting that they were all untitled.

Lán WàngJī replied to his unspoken question, “It’s up to you to choose a title for each of the volumes.”

Puzzled, Wèi WúXiàn opened the volume and began to turn the pages. As he kept on skimming through the volume, Wèi WúXiàn became more and more astonished; it was a collection of his own manuscripts on demonic power methods.

“Lán Zhàn, this is—” Wèi WúXiàn was dumbfounded that he couldn't finish his sentence. He had never been diligent in writing a book. He always scribbled his work randomly.

However, unknown to him, Lán WàngJī had progressively gathered his random scribbles into a compilation.

“Lán Zhàn, this must have taken you a tremendous amount of time to complete.”

“Wèi Yīng, the elders have all agreed that once your Golden Core is formed, you can take up a formal teaching position and teach the demonic power methods,” said Lán WàngJī.

“What?!” Wèi WúXiàn cried out and almost jumped up, as if he was struck by lightning.

It was an honour to have been given a teaching position in the GūsūLán sect. And the most incredible thing was that they allowed him to teach the demonic power methods!

“How could they agree on this?” asked Wèi WúXiàn, while thinking that this matter was very delicate for a respectable sect like GūsūLán and could not possibly be settled that easily.

Lán WàngJī replied, “After many rounds of discussion, the elders have finally consented to my request in letting you become a teacher.”

He went on, “Demonic powers also have many useful uses. Instead of letting those who practise on their own go astray, it’s better that you teach and supervise them, as well as set rules and regulations.”

Still holding the volume, Wèi WúXiàn was speechless, and his hands were slightly trembling; he couldn’t believe his ears.

“So, in other words,” thought Wèi WúXiàn, “when we started the dual cultivation, Lán Zhàn was sure that I would form a new Golden Core and began to debate the teaching position with his uncle and the elders.

“Then, when I lost my memories, he sent an invitation letter to Mián-Mián to come to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù along with her husband and daughter.

“Lán Zhàn went all out to do all this for my sake.”

In a lovely and tender tone, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you are the originator of the demonic power. Therefore, you are the most suitable person to teach others how to use this power.”

Then, he sincerely added, “Wèi Yīng, you have a lot of talent; there’s no need to hide it.”

“Xiōng-zhǎng also said the same thing,” thought Wèi WúXiàn.

He then tried to picture Lán WàngJī putting forward arguments in front of the elders during their debating sessions.

Lán WàngJī looked at him and noticed that he was miles away. To get his attention, he gently kissed Wèi WúXiàn on the forehead, then he asked, “Wèi Yīng, are you happy to take this teaching position?”

Wèi WúXiàn suddenly wrapped his arms around Lán WàngJī’s shoulders, buried his face in Lán WàngJī’s neck, and then let out a muffled “uh-huh” sound multiple times.

Lán WàngJī chuckled and said, “It’s settled, then.”

Wèi WúXiàn then put the volume back into the brocade box, and then, he slowly closed the box as though he was daydreaming.

Suddenly, he felt uneasy and asked, “What if I ruin GūsūLán’s reputation by teaching demonic power methods? What if other sects decide not to send their people to attend courses here at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù because of that?”

Lán WàngJī reassured him, “You will not ruin the reputation of GūsūLán, and they will still come here, all of them.”

“How can you be so sure?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.

Proudly and confidently, Lán WàngJī replied, “Because it’s you, and no one else. Your talent is unparalleled. You are so brilliant that you are far ahead of others.”

He went on, “They all admire you and are all envious of your talent. They want to catch up with you. Therefore, they will definitely come to learn your methods.”

Wèi WúXiàn could read trust and admiration in Lán WàngJī’s eyes, which made him float on air.

“Are you happy now?” asked Lán WàngJī.

Wèi WúXiàn’s feeling of joy and happiness was beyond words, so that, after opening his mouth to reply, he couldn’t let out even an inaudible sound. So, he mindlessly nodded his head.

Then Lán WàngJī finally took him to the bed and said, “Now, it’s my turn to receive a gift from you.”

The news that Yílíng Lǎozǔ would start to teach demonic power methods in autumn resounded like thunderclaps across the sky and quickly spread among the hundreds of sects.

All sects, small or large, held discussions about it, and the general opinion was that GūsūLán's decision was a disrespect for their hundred years of good reputation. Some among them were disdainful, while others mocked their decision.

Across the territories, HánGuāng-Jūn and Yílíng Lǎozǔ were once more at the forefront of the local gossip.

All this ruckus carried on until the day of the enrolment to attend Yílíng Lǎozǔ’s class.

Surprisingly, the first sect to arrive at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù was QīnghéNiè. As the head of the sect, Niè HuáiSāng brought along a dozen of disciples for them to get enrolled.

The next to arrive was a sect affiliated to QīnghéNiè, led by Ouyang Zizhen, who came with twenty young relatives.

Standing at the gate to welcome guests, Wèi WúXiàn looked at a sleeping child whom Ouyang Zizhen was carrying in his arms and could not help but laugh.

Then, he asked, “Zizhen, who is this?”

Ouyang Zizhen replied, “Wèi-qiánbèi, this is my young brother. He is seven years old and has already started to learn the basics. Could you please accept him as well?”

While smiling, Wèi WúXiàn, in the same tone as Lán WàngJī’s, replied, “No, I can’t.”

Then, he added, “He is too young to attend my class. What if he starts to cry during the lesson?”

The following sects to arrive were all affiliated with YúnmèngJiāng. Soon after, the hesitant ones rushed in like a tsunami after seeing that many sects had already enrolled their young disciples.

Among all those cultivators, who once wanted him dead while still using the devices that he had made, who didn’t know that Yílíng Lǎozǔ possessed an outstanding talent? They were all eager not to miss out on learning Yílíng Lǎozǔ’s extraordinary skills.

Yú XiǎoShān was the only one from the MéishānYú sect to come to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù. As the heir of his sect, strangely, he didn’t have any underlings and seemed like he had run away from home.

Since he didn’t want people to notice that he was alone, he sneaked into the group led by Ouyang Zizhen. In the afternoon, however, many members of his sect joined him.

In the morning of the second day of the enrolment, after the hustle and bustle of the first day, six disciples from the YúnmèngJiāng sect arrived.

Despite their small group, the YúnmèngJiāng disciples were the best among their fellows and were known as the Six Pillars of the Lotus Piers. They were also close to Wèi WúXiàn.

In defiance of Jiāng Chéng, the LánlíngJīn sect arrived at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù for the enrolment.

Wearing his sword on his waist and a spear on his back, Jīn Líng defiantly said, “I don’t need to listen to my uncle. I volunteered myself to be the last one to come here for your class.”

<br />&nbsp;
... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

In the evening, Lán WàngJī held Wèi WúXiàn tenderly in his arms while thinking that his move was successful. Most sects had sent their close relatives and even their heirs to learn demonic powers.

In the future, they would no longer have the right to slander his Wèi Yīng or say that demonic power methods were a heretical way of cultivating that should be eradicated.

And also, all those young disciples, who would attend Wèi WúXiàn’s class, would respect him as their teacher and form a bond with him.

“Wèi Yīng.” Lán WàngJī kissed Wèi WúXiàn with all the love and passion he felt for him.

He then thought, “This wonderful person with an unparalleled talent is mine. He should found a sect and truly shine.”
