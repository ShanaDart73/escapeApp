Since Wèi WúXiàn’s new Golden Core had shattered into pieces and scattered in his spiritual veins, the only way to gather all the fragments was to penetrate into the realm of his unconscious mind.

Wèi WúXiàn’s current spiritual power was too weak to collect those fragments and form a Golden Core on its own within three days.

Furthermore, if the fragments happened to melt completely in his spiritual veins, it would be no longer possible to form another Golden Core.

Since Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual power was weak, during their dual cultivation, it was Lán WàngJī who was using his to guide Wèi WúXiàn’s flow of spiritual power.

However, by doing so, their spiritual powers both blended together, and, as a result, when the new Golden Core was formed, its properties were similar to the properties of Lán WàngJī’s Golden Core.

That explained why Lán WàngJī could draw Suíbiàn while Jiāng Chéng couldn't.

Lán WàngJī knew that to gather all the fragments of the Golden Core, he had to penetrate into the realm of Wèi WúXiàn’s unconscious mind. And then, he had to use again his semen as the medium to blend their unconscious minds, as well as their spiritual powers.

And, since their Golden Cores shared the same properties, Lán WàngJī would use his Golden Core to trace those fragments that were scattered in Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual veins.

Once he entered his unconscious mind and began to channel, Lán WàngJī might discover Wèi WúXiàn’s deepest desire, as well as watch the images of Wèi WúXiàn’s deepest memories.

Wèi WúXiàn had fallen asleep. However, Lán WàngJī really wanted to enter his unconscious mind while he was awake. He wanted Wèi WúXiàn to reach yet another climax and blended their souls and bodies together.

Nevertheless, he began to dive deeper and then succeeded in penetrating into the realm of Wèi WúXiàn's unconscious mind.  Once inside, he closed his eyes for a moment to listen to the flow of Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual power; then, he opened his eyes and began to channel.

Inside Wèi WúXiàn’s unconscious mind was all dark and silent, like being in an empty place deprived of any source of light and sound. It was so quiet that Lán WàngJī could even hear his breath and heartbeat.

It seemed like a long time had passed before Lán WàngJī began to hear some whispers.

Those faint voices seemed to come from far away, travelling like a gentle breeze at first, then, gradually, they became distinct and abundant.

The voices appeared to be some fragments of Wèi WúXiàn’s memories, coming all over the place in a chaotic manner.

To distinguish every speech of these voices, Lán WàngJī closed his eyes again and began to concentrate.

As he focused on one of Wèi WúXiàn's memories, Lán WàngJī recognised the scene: the two of them in the Cold Spring of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, back when they were teenagers.

“Stop splashing around.” “But water is so cold.” “What are you doing?” “I’m just coming towards where you are, because water is warmer around you.”

Then, Lán WàngJī caught another scene; it was when Wèi WúXiàn confessed his love to him.

“Lán Zhàn! Lán WàngJī! HánGuāng-Jūn! Earlier, I sincerely wanted to sleep with you!” “Lán Zhàn, listen to me.” “I really have a bad memory. I don’t remember everything that happened in the past, including that night.”

“You are really wonderful. I like you.” “In other words, I love you. I want you. I can’t bear to be parted from you.” “I want to spend the rest of my life Night Hunting with you.”

“I want to sleep with you every single day.”  “I swear I’m not teasing you like I did before, nor expressing my gratitude to you.” “It’s simply because I love you.”

“I don’t want anyone unless it’s you.” “It can’t be anyone but you.” “You can do whatever you want with me, as long as you are willing to be with me.”

Lán WàngJī carried on, moving from one of Wèi WúXiàn's deepest memories to the next, until he suddenly realised that all of his memories were about him.

This was why his Wèi Yīng remembered ‘WàngXiàn’, the name of the melody he hummed for him earlier. Although Wèi WúXiàn knew the tune since they were teenagers, he didn’t know the name back then.

That would also explain why his Wèi Yīng was able to read his facial expression and felt his pain this morning. Even though Wèi WúXiàn’s memories were gone, his feeling for him was still there.

And, in turn, this would explain why his Wèi Yīng could naturally touch him and let himself be touched by him, as well as trust him completely; he felt at ease by his side to the extent that he could easily and deeply fall asleep.

That's why his Wèi Yīng fell in love with him again.

Also, his Wèi Yīng had promised him that, from now on, he would remember everything he would do or say to him, that he wouldn’t any longer forget any of them.

Hence, all these precious memories were still there, deep in his unconscious mind.

As Lán WàngJī carried on channelling further, the voices gradually faded away. And, soon, he reached the core of Wèi WúXiàn’s unconscious mind.

In front of him, there was some sort of cave, and the inside of that cave was dimly lighted.

Lán WàngJī stepped into the cave and saw two people; one was Wèi WúXiàn, sitting on the floor with his back leaning against the wall, and the other was himself, half-kneeling in front of Wèi WúXiàn, and both of them were covered with blood.

The other Lán WàngJī was holding Wèi WúXiàn’s hands, and, earnestly, he was saying something to him. But Lán WàngJī could not hear anything of what the other him was saying.

Lán WàngJī then walked closer to them to hear what the other him was saying to Wèi WúXiàn, but, still, his attempt was in vain.

On the other hand, he was able to see such a tenderness in Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes as he looked at the other him. He also heard him say in a gentle voice, “All right, Lán Zhàn, I will go with you. Please, take me home.”

Then, Wèi WúXiàn tenderly put both his hands on the other Lán WàngJī’s cheeks and began to repeat his words. As he did so, his voice was getting louder, while his tone was becoming resolved.

Then, finally, he shouted, “Lán Zhàn, take me to GūsūLán!”

And, all of a sudden, their surroundings were replaced with a beautiful scene full of colourful flowers and luxuriant green grass.

As for Lán WàngJī, he was filled with happiness by these simple words. No wonder his Wèi Yīng said this morning, “I won’t go. If you don’t want me to go, then I’ll stay with you.”

Earlier, he felt a little bit disappointed because instead of a silence from Wèi WúXiàn, he was expecting another vehement confession.

“How foolish I was!” thought Lán WàngJī. “I no longer need any proof of love from Wèi Yīng. His shouted words just now were the best* confession.”

<small>*Before Wèi WúXiàn’s death, Lán WàngJī had pestered him to come with him to GūsūLán (that was his clumsy way of saying ‘I love you’ to Wèi WúXiàn). And now, finally, Wèi WúXiàn returns his feeling by saying, ‘Take me to GūsūLán.’</small>

“Wèi Yīng,” in his deep voice, Lán WàngJī called him to get his attention.

Then, Wèi WúXiàn turned his head and looked at him. Meanwhile, the other Lán WàngJī began to fade away.

Lán WàngJī then positioned himself at the exact place the other him was and held Wèi WúXiàn’s hands, while Wèi WúXiàn appeared to be stunned.

In a voice full of tenderness, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, I’ll take you with me back to GūsūLán.”

Then, with a bright smile on his face, Wèi WúXiàn quickly hugged Lán WàngJī.

Lán WàngJī also embraced him in his arms. And, when Wèi WúXiàn raised his head towards him, they fondly kissed each other.

After their kisses, the scenery changed again. Now, they were in Jingshi.

In their room, Bìchén and Suíbiàn were hung on the wall, some music notes were on the table, and their shelf was filled with various books and rare objects that Wèi WúXiàn brought home whenever he visited a place.

Lán WàngJī then carried Wèi WúXiàn to the bed, and then, he slowly removed Wèi WúXiàn’s clothes, and then, he did the same with his clothes.

Once both of them were naked, Lán WàngJī lay on top of Wèi WúXiàn.

“Wèi Yīng.” He gently began to call Wèi WúXiàn again and again while caressing his soft skin. They were in perfect harmony, blended by the love they felt for each other.

Lán WàngJī then closed his eyes and released a flow of his spiritual power. The blue light spread like circular ripples, and then some gentle notes of music, which seemed to be emitted by Wangji, filled the room.

Soon after, the fragments of Wèi WúXiàn’s Golden Core slowly began to gather until they formed a perfect and shiny golden sphere.

Then, Lán WàngJī guided the Golden Core to Wèi WúXiàn’s Golden Core vessel.
