Lán WàngJī seemed to gulp involuntarily. “Are you done drinking?” he asked.

Wèi WúXiàn then let go of Lán WàngJī’s hand, as well as removing his lips from the cup, and then he nodded.

On his lower lip, some tiny droplets of water were softly sparkling, which made the delicate red lips become more sensual.

At the sight of these inviting lips, Lán WàngJī unconsciously clenched his free hand into a fist; he said, “All right.” Then he walked to the table to put back the cup.

For a short while, none of them spoke; then, suddenly, Lán WàngJī, who was still standing by the table, walked back to Wèi WúXiàn and hugged him.

As one would expect, Wèi WúXiàn did not push him away or struggle to set himself free; he just let Lán WàngJī embrace him.

Then, Lán WàngJī carried Wèi WúXiàn in his arms, went to the bed, and laid him down.

Wèi WúXiàn then sat up and looked at Lán WàngJī, who was standing by the bed, tall and silent. Light from the candle cast a shadow on his face, so Wèi WúXiàn was unable to see his expression.

His breathing quickened, then, after a short while, Wèi WúXiàn shifted so as to make room in the bed, quietly inviting Lán WàngJī.

Lán WàngJī slowly sat down on the bed, then, in a hoarse voice, he asked, “You can’t sleep?”

“I can’t find sleep,” he replied. “Lull me to sleep.”

With his slender fingers, Lán WàngJī stroked Wèi WúXiàn’s fringe, then gently tucked it behind the ear. He looked into his eyes and began to hum a gentle and serene tune, the same tune that Wèi WúXiàn played in the morning.

Wèi WúXiàn began to stare at Lán WàngJī vacantly, while his mind was gradually wandering away. Then, after a while, he dreamily uttered, ‘WàngXiàn’.

Lán WàngJī abruptly stopped humming; his eyes widened in surprise.

“Lán Zhàn, isn’t ‘WàngXiàn’ the name of the tune that you just hummed?” he asked.

Lán WàngJī’s breathing became so heavy that one could clearly see the up and down movements of his chest; he replied, “Yes.”

Then, Wèi WúXiàn began to ask a series of questions.

“Lán Zhàn, didn’t you give me the white guqin as a gift?” he asked.

“Yes, I did,” he replied.

“Didn’t I give you the white bracelet that you wore today?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.

“Yes, you did,” Lán WàngJī replied.

“Do we usually wear similar clothes, travel together, and read the same novels? he asked. "You even know my favourite passages."

“Yes, that’s correct,” he replied.

This time, however, before asking his question, Wèi WúXiàn nervously clenched his fists, then he took a deep breath. “Lán Zhàn, what kind of relationship do we have?”

“What do you think?” Lán WàngJī asked. Then he sighed and went on, “Wèi Yīng, what kind of relationship do you wish us to have?”

As he spoke, the warm yellow light of the candle showered on his eyelashes. Lán WàngJī intensively fixed his lustful eyes on Wèi WúXiàn.

With Lán WàngJī's beautiful face, having this sensual expression with this burning gaze, in addition, in this suggestive atmosphere, Wèi WúXiàn seemed to have lost reason; his whole body began to ignite.

Then, impulsively, he moved forward and kissed Lán WàngJī so passionately that he hit his lower lip against Lán WàngJī’s teeth.

The slight pain felt from his lip brought back his senses; he hastily retreated and quickly began to say, “This is not...”

Lán WàngJī pulled him in his arms, then, feverishly, he began to kiss him. Lán WàngJī’s tongue went deep into his mouth, sweeping every area of it, and then he entwined his tongue with his, bringing it out and sucking it with all the passion he had.

Wèi WúXiàn let out a moan that caused Lán WàngJī to pause. Then, he resumed shortly after; however, this time, his kisses became more gentle.

Lán WàngJī untied Wèi WúXiàn’s hair ribbon, and then, slowly, he ran his fingers through his long hair, and then, he gently slid his fingers behind Wèi WúXiàn’s neck and then carried on caressing his back, progressively moving down and stroking Wèi WúXiàn’s slender waist.

Meanwhile, his tongue still explored Wèi WúXiàn’s mouth, softly intertwining their tongues.

Then, Lán WàngJī began to tease Wèi WúXiàn; he slowly ran the tip of his tongue on Wèi WúXiàn’s soft and sensitive lips, tracing the edges of the lips.

Then, at his leisure, he gave Wèi WúXiàn a series of soft kisses on the forehead, on the eyelids, on the cheeks, and on the top and lower lips, as well as on the corners of the lips. Then, he gently began to suck Wèi WúXiàn’s lips.

Wèi WúXiàn began to feel woozy from Lán WàngJī’s kisses; his whole body became hot.

After a while, Lán WàngJī released him; then, in a deep voice, he asked, “Wèi Yīng, did you dislike it?”

Wèi WúXiàn looked at him with a dazed expression on his face; he absent-mindedly asked, “What?”

Lán WàngJī kissed him again, then he asked, “You don’t like it when I kiss you?”

“How could I possibly dislike it?” replied Wèi WúXiàn. “Shouldn't I be the one asking that question?”

Lán WàngJī smiled, then kissed him softly, and then, he confessed, “Wèi Yīng, in Baifeng Mountain*, it was me who kissed you.”

<small>*Baifeng Mountain is the place where Lán WàngJī steals Wèi WúXiàn’s first kiss, furtively.</small>

“What?” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, extremely surprised; this revelation sobered him up.

Lán WàngJī, however, did not let him remain sober, as he began to kiss him again, and, this time, his kisses were vigorous, impatient and fiery.

He hugged Wèi WúXiàn tight, his lips devoured his, and then he slid his tongue into his mouth and entangled it with Wèi WúXiàn’s tongue.

After playing with his tongue, Lán WàngJī returned to Wèi WúXiàn’s lips and began to kiss and suck them until they became numb and until Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body began to beg for more.

Then, Lán WàngJī slid his hands through Wèi WúXiàn’s sleeves; the palms of his hands were so comfortably warm that they made Wèi WúXiàn become more inviting.

Furthermore, compared to when Lán WàngJī caressed him through his nightclothes, the feeling of his hands directly stroking every inch of his bare back made Wèi WúXiàn feel more and more horny; he was trembling with pleasure.

Lán WàngJī moved one hand down to Wèi WúXiàn’s hips and slid it through the underwear, and then, gently, he began to stroke his hips, while his other hand carried on caressing Wèi WúXiàn’s back.

As he realised that he became hard, Wèi WúXiàn felt ashamed, and, in order to prevent Lán WàngJī from noticing it, he put his hands against Lán WàngJī’s chest and moved back.

Lán WàngJī didn’t want to force him; he just let go of him, and then, they looked at each other; both were out of breath from their kisses and burning desire for each other.

Lán WàngJī looked like someone who had reached his limit; the desire shown through his eyes was so strong that there was no word to describe it, and Wèi WúXiàn had not seen Lán WàngJī’s eyes look to that extent.

Controlling his desire, Lán WàngJī put his hand on Wèi WúXiàn’s shoulder, and the latter could not help but tremble a little bit.

Lán WàngJī paused, and then, he began to adjust Wèi WúXiàn’s nightclothes, and, accidentally, his fingers brushed his neck, and Wèi WúXiàn moaned, which stirred Lán WàngJī.

With great effort, Lán WàngJī got a hold of himself, and, slowly, he began to withdraw his hand; however, Wèi WúXiàn caught Lán WàngJī’s hand, and the latter looked at him with a questioning expression on his face.

And then, he said out loud his greatest desire, “Wèi Yīng, I want you.

Wèi WúXiàn slowly nodded in agreement, and Lán WàngJī, without losing any moment, began to untie the top of Wèi WúXiàn’s nightclothes.

As Lán WàngJī undressed him, it seemed to Wèi WúXiàn that everything was running in slow motion, namely, the time taken for his top to slide off of his shoulders and the time Lán WàngJī took to hold his arms and peel off the sleeves, as well as completely removing his nightclothes.

“Wèi Yīng?” Lán WàngJī’s eyes seemed to ask Wèi WúXiàn if he was ready to receive him, which made Wèi WúXiàn extremely embarrassed that he felt like covering his naked body.

“I... I am a little bit skinny now.” Then, he remembered that this current body was not his original one.

Earlier, when he was taking a bath, he was so preoccupied by the nature of their relationship that it didn’t cross his mind to have a look at his new body.

Lán WàngJī thought that he was comparing his current body to his former one; he said, “Wèi Yīng, you look handsome, and your body is really attractive.”

Then, he began to caress Wèi WúXiàn’s neck, then his shoulders, and then his chest, pinching and twisting slightly his nipples.

“Aah,” Wèi WúXiàn gave a moan of pleasure.

“Wèi Yīng, in order to keep you satisfied, I learned how to cook,” whispered Lán WàngJī to his ear. “I’ll cook whatever you want me to cook for you.”

“Uh-huh,” agreed Wèi WúXiàn, and, somehow, he seemed not surprised to learn that Lán WàngJī could cook.

Lán WàngJī then carried on stroking his whole upper body, slowly and gently.

Wèi WúXiàn was feeling very embarrassed as well as overwhelmed by the way Lán WàngJī touched me while looking at him with his burning desire written in his eyes.

He could not help but say, “Lán Zhàn, can you stop looking at me? It’s really embarrassing.”

Lán WàngJī chuckled, and then, gently, he pushed him down on the bed and lay on top of Wèi WúXiàn, and then, he began to kiss his lips, slowly moving down and gently biting his neck and shoulder, and then, he moved further down, licking and biting Wèi WúXiàn’s nipples.

For several days, he did not touch Wèi WúXiàn, and, moreover, for two days, Wèi WúXiàn’s body was soaked wet; as a result, his bite marks on Wèi WúXiàn’s skin had all vanished, Lán WàngJī noted.

After leaving his marks on Wèi WúXiàn, Lán WàngJī, in turn, began to suck both nipples.

Wèi WúXiàn never knew that being touched by the nipples could feel so strong. He could not help but struggle to set himself free.

This time, however, Lán WàngJī didn’t let him escape. He took Wèi WúXiàn’s wrists, put them above Wèi WúXiàn’s head, and, with one hand, held both wrists steady on the bed, and then, he carried on sucking his nipples.
