Lán WàngJī then sucked Wèi WúXiàn’s earlobe, and then, he whispered to his ear, “Wèi Yīng, I want to hear your moans.”

Wèi WúXiàn wondered, “Did I hear it wrong? Is it really Lán Zhàn? Such lecherous words coming from his mouth sound extremely arousing.”

Then, Lán WàngJī showed no mercy; his fingers went deeper inside Wèi WúXiàn, and continuously, he rubbed his P-spot, which had, as a result, made Wèi WúXiàn cry out loud.

Gradually, Lán WàngJī sped up the movements of his fingers inside Wèi WúXiàn.

As Lán WàngJī kept on stimulating his P-spot, Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body was filled with an intense feeling of pleasure, and his mind seemed to float in the air. Then, finally, he released once again.

Lán WàngJī then stopped moving his fingers and, slowly, withdrew them, and then, he kissed Wèi WúXiàn on the forehead, which was now covered with tiny little droplets of sweat.

Wèi WúXiàn gazed vacantly in front of him, the opening of his hole kept on throbbing, and, for a short while, his mind went blank.

“Good grief! Just by using his fingers, Lán Zhàn made me come,” thought Wèi WúXiàn. “I should return the favour.”

Then, he sat up once more to take off Lán WàngJī’s nightclothes; however, he was pushed back on the bed once again.

Lán WàngJī took off his forehead ribbon, loosely tied Wèi WúXiàn’s wrists above the head, and then secured the ribbon on the bedhead.

Since the ribbon was not firmly tied around his wrists, Wèi WúXiàn could easily free himself; however, he opted not to do it.

Then, Lán WàngJī took off his nightclothes, including his underwear, opened a small black box laid by one corner of the bed, took out a container of ointment, and then applied ointment on his manhood, despite Wèi WúXiàn already being wet.

As he lubricated his private parts, Wèi WúXiàn looked at Lán WàngJī’s manhood and was shocked. “Sheesh! Why are you so big?”

Then, he wondered, “Will this huge stuff fit in me?”

Lán WàngJī then held Wèi WúXiàn by the hips, and the latter, unconsciously, moved backwards.

In a gentle tone, Lán WàngJī reassured him, “Wèi Yīng, don’t be afraid. I won’t be ruthless.”

“Here we go again with his attitude: 'Don’t worry, I’ll teach you,'” thought Wèi WúXiàn, a little bit annoyed, and quickly replied, “Who is afraid? If you want to put it in, just go ahead. I have plenty of experience.”

Then, both of them were stunned by the last sentence, since Wèi WúXiàn had said the same thing before.

“Wèi Yīng!” Lán WàngJī looked at him with an eye that conveyed all the love he had for him, because his words brought him back to their conversation in Baifeng Mountain, just shortly after he had stolen his first kiss.

Since he had lost his memories, Wèi WúXiàn couldn’t remember that he had already told Lán WàngJī that it was a lie. He interpreted Lán WàngJī’s loving expression as, ‘Even though you have done it with others, I still love you.’

So, since he didn’t want Lán WàngJī to have a wrong opinion of him, he hurriedly said, “It’s not true. I don’t have any experience. Trust me. This is my first time doing it with you.”

Then, Lán WàngJī understood that Wèi WúXiàn bragged about his “experience” because he didn’t want to look like a novice.

As he noticed some change in Lán WàngJī’s expression, Wèi WúXiàn thought that he didn’t believe him.

So, wrapping his legs around Lán WàngJī’s waist, Wèi WúXiàn said, “I’ve never even held any girl’s hands. Lán Zhàn, you are the only one for me, and, in the future, there will be only you.”

Then, he felt relieved to have said the truth.

However, by mentioning girls, Wèi WúXiàn had unknowingly touched a topic that was like a thorn piercing Lán WàngJī’s heart, since the latter was extremely jealous each time Wèi WúXiàn was flirting with girls.

Lán WàngJī took a deep breath and suppressed all those old jealousies he had felt, reminding himself that, right now, the most important thing was to make Wèi WúXiàn feel good.

Placing his hands on Wèi WúXiàn’s backs of knees, Lán WàngJī moved his knees close to his chest, making his whole body curve.

Under this posture, Lán WàngJī had a full view of Wèi WúXiàn’s private parts.

Wèi WúXiàn did not recall having seen such a posture in the erotic books he had read.

“This is really indecent,” thought Wèi WúXiàn. “Is Lán Zhàn going to put his stuff in this lewd posture? Is this his first time?”

“Wèi Yīng, look at me. I’m going to put mine inside you,” said Lán WàngJī, and then he held his huge manhood and inserted only the head, letting Wèi WúXiàn get used to it.

After a short while, he added, “Wèi Yīng, watch carefully.” Then, slowly, he inserted the whole stuff.

“Aaah!” Wèi WúXiàn could not help but moan. He didn’t know what was more stimulating; was it Lán WàngJī's deep voice, or was it the view of his manhood entering him, or was it the sensation he felt for having Lán WàngJī inside him?

With Lán WàngJī’s manhood fully inserted inside him, Wèi WúXiàn felt that the inside of his hole was reshaped to fit Lán WàngJī’s size.

Then, Lán WàngJī began to move, slowly making the back-and-forward motions so as to let Wèi WúXiàn adapt to his size.

His soft movements, however, were enough to make Wèi WúXiàn let out some soft cries.

Lán WàngJī was very gentle; however, at the same time, he seemed to let Wèi WúXiàn know that he was a little bit jealous. Wèi WúXiàn somehow felt good to know that Lán WàngJī was jealous.

Except for the swollen sensation felt when Lán WàngJī entered him, Wèi WúXiàn experienced great pleasure for his "first time" because of Lán WàngJī's plenty of foreplay.

While making a great effort not to lose control, Lán WàngJī carried on moving slowly and gently inside Wèi WúXiàn.

So, gradually, the swollen sensation that Wèi WúXiàn had felt changed into sexual pleasure. And all this happened while Wèi WúXiàn was watching.

He then felt too embarrassed to keep on watching Lán WàngJī moving inside him and turned his gaze away.

“Wèi Yīng, don’t look away,” said Lán WàngJī. Then he held Wèi WúXiàn’s chin and made him turn his head towards him.

Watching Lán WàngJī moving his manhood back and forth inside him, again and again, was indeed very erotic.

However, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t want to be the only one feeling embarrassed; he asked, “Does it feel good, being inside me?”

Unknown to him, because of his amnesia, this was not the first time he asked Lán WàngJī this question. In other words, the latter had already got used to it.

So, by observing Wèi WúXiàn’s expression, Lán WàngJī saw through him, and he replied, “It does feel good.” Then, he asked, “Do you want me to move fast?”

Wèi WúXiàn felt that his face was suddenly burned with embarrassment by Lán WàngJī’s question.

As he noticed that Wèi WúXiàn got used to his huge stuff, Lán WàngJī began to move faster and vigorously bumped every small area inside Wèi WúXiàn.

Soon after, the sound of his back-and-forth motion became audible, and some white foam began to form inside Wèi WúXiàn and coated around Lán WàngJī’s manhood.

Wèi WúXiàn didn’t dare to watch any longer, so he closed his eyes. However, the fact of closing his eyes made him feel Lán WàngJī even more intensively. The sexual pleasure slid along his spine and carried on throughout his whole body, including his fingertips and toes.

“Wèi Yīng, don’t close your eyes. Keep watching,” said Lán WàngJī.

Wèi WúXiàn then obeyed and opened his eyes just as Lán WàngJī moved his huge stuff back, displaying a full view of his manhood covered with white fluid.

The watery sound coming from his hole seemed to have increased, as Lán WàngJī now moved his stuff forth, deeply penetrating inside him, and making Wèi WúXiàn feel extremely good, so that he reached the high point.

Wèi WúXiàn thought that it was too much. With his wrists still loosely tied above his head, he scratched on the framework of the bedhead with his fingers.

The stimulating view of being penetrated over and over and the pleasure of Lán WàngJī's back-and-forth movements kept on piling up within him.

In a low voice, he called, “Lán Zhàn.” Wèi WúXiàn was overwhelmed in such extreme pleasure.

Lán WàngJī seemed to have smiled; he leaned forward and gave Wèi WúXiàn a light kiss on the lips. As though he was stimulated by Wèi WúXiàn calling his name, Lán WàngJī began to move even faster and more intensively.

“Ah... ah... ahh... agh... Lán Zhàn, I’m still a virgin,” said Wèi WúXiàn between moans and gasps.

Lán WàngJī simply replied, “I know.” However, he didn’t slow down but kept on bumping faster and harder.

Although his posture was not quite comfortable, Wèi WúXiàn felt extreme pleasure under Lán WàngJī’s vigorous back-and-forth motions.

Wèi WúXiàn kept on moaning louder and louder, feeling an intense sensation from his hole, and his swollen manhood began to ache.

Since he had intensified his movements, Lán WàngJī was afraid that Wèi WúXiàn would not be able to keep up, so he decided to change Wèi WúXiàn’s posture.

He rested Wèi WúXiàn’s legs on his shoulders, grabbed a few pillows and put them under Wèi WúXiàn’s loins.

Following Lán WàngJī’s action, Wèi WúXiàn seemed to understand why, earlier, he had noticed that there were so many pillows on the bed.

However, he could not ponder on the matter much longer, because Lán WàngJī now raised his buttocks and placed them in the way that he could directly hit Wèi WúXiàn’s weak spot; then, he resumed bumping inside him.

“Aaah... Lán Zhàn... agh... it feels so good... I can’t take it any more... I’m coming again.”

Lán WàngJī then held Wèi WúXiàn’s swollen manhood and began to rub it up and down while he kept on pounding inside him.

And, soon after, like a volcano in eruption, a series of white fluids was ejected from it, while Wèi WúXiàn was crying and trembling uncontrollably, and, at the same time, Lán WàngJī was also releasing inside him.

After a short while, Wèi WúXiàn said while panting, “Agh... Lán Zhàn, you’re really awesome.”

Lán WàngJī then leaned over him and began to stroke his upper body gently and softly; then, he moved his hand down, fondling Wèi WúXiàn’s hips.

Under Lán WàngJī’s caress, Wèi WúXiàn felt so fulfilled that he freed his wrists from the ribbon, wrapped his arms around Lán WàngJī’s neck, and began to kiss him tenderly.

Lán WàngJī held him tight and kissed him back.

The overwhelming pleasure that Wèi WúXiàn felt slowly quietened down. A tranquil atmosphere now enveloped them.

However, in this serene mood, Lán WàngJī’s huge stuff was still erect.

Soon, he began to move again inside Wèi WúXiàn, and the latter, surprised, called out, “Lán Zhàn!”

As a reply to the call, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, that will take a while.”
