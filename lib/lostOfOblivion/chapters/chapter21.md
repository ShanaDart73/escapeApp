Wèi WúXiàn slowly opened his eyes; he didn’t straight away notice that it was already morning, because the bed curtains were blocking out the sunlight.

When he drew the curtains, the lovely sunshine shone in his eyes and made him squint.

Not yet fully awake, Wèi WúXiàn inwardly said, while still holding the curtains, “This fabric is expensive to the touch.”

Then, suddenly, he became aware of what happened the night before. “Wait a minute! If this room is Jingshi, then that means that it was not a dream!”

He then pushed away the blanket so as to examine his body and noticed here and there some red marks of love bites.

“These marks mean that...” Wèi WúXiàn was trying to find his words, while his mind was in a state of amazement, “...that Lán Zhàn and I did it! We really slept together!”

He went on, “Why is Lán Zhàn so awesome? Not only is he very good-looking, but also...” Wèi WúXiàn felt shy* to finish his sentence; he then added, “Lán Zhàn is really good at everything.”

<small>*But also he is good in bed.</small>

Then, he realised, “Wait! Something feels different inside me. It’s a Golden Core! How strange is that, at my waking up, to find that I have a Golden Core!”

“I’ll let it be for now,” he decided. “Eventually, things will clear up. Right now, I have something else in mind.”

“Lán Zhàn said that we are a married couple.” For a short period of time, the last two words resonated inside his head.

Wèi WúXiàn went on, “He also said, ‘Wèi Yīng, in BǎiFèngShān, it was me who kissed you.’. It was really an amazing surprise to learn that Lán Zhàn has started to like me since back then.”

Then, he kept on recalling what Lán WàngJī said to him, ’<em>Wèi Yīng, I love you.</em>’ "That is just too much.” Wèi WúXiàn was already overexcited.

“‘Wèi Yīng, I want you. Doing it only once is not enough.’ Lán Zhàn actually said something like that to me!”

Wèi WúXiàn had wrapped the blanket around him from head to toe and carried on replaying every single word Lán WàngJī said, and, at the time, he was rolling on the bed like a child.

From time to time, he would suppress an overjoyed shriek by putting his hand over his mouth.

Upon entering the room, Lán WàngJī saw something that resembled a giant caterpillar that was twisting and turning on the bed, which made him smile a little bit.

Lán WàngJī then put on the table some dishes that he brought along before walking to the bed.

He bent down and said, “Wèi Yīng, you're awake? Do you want to eat——”

Lán WàngJī didn’t finish talking when Wèi WúXiàn spread out the blanket, covered Lán WàngJī’s upper body, pulled him on the bed, and then jumped on top of him.

Wèi WúXiàn then tossed away the blanket and began to touch Lán WàngJī’s body; then, he attempted to remove his clothes.

However, Lán WàngJī began to resist and said, “Great warrior, please, spare my life.”

“My little angel, I won’t take your life. I just want to deflower you,” replied Wèi WúXiàn.

He then resumed trying to remove Lán WàngJī’s clothes. However, Lán WàngJī put his arms across his chest. With his mighty strength, Wèi WúXiàn was unable to pull off his clothes.

“Great warrior, I already have someone I like,” said Lán WàngJī.

Wèi WúXiàn then asked, “Can I be the one you like?”

Lán WàngJī appeared to think carefully about it, then he replied, “Why not? It doesn’t make any difference.”

Wèi WúXiàn looked at him with surprise, and then he burst into loud laughter. When he was done laughing, in a short interval, he gave Lán WàngJī two very light kisses, as though he was a butterfly landing on Lán WàngJī’s lips.

Lán WàngJī then hugged him and rolled over so as to be on top, and then, he deeply kissed him. A long and deep kiss that made them pant afterwards.

“Why are you so happy?” asked Lán WàngJī after a short while.

“That’s because, when I woke up, I found out that you are mine. So, naturally, I’m happy.” Then, he added, “Come on, give your great warrior another treat.”

After the treat, Lán WàngJī told him to eat while the food was still warm.

Shortly after a quick wash, Wèi WúXiàn was sitting at the table, removing the lids from the plates to see what Lán WàngJī had brought.

There was shredded chicken, a bowl of congee topped with roasted chestnuts, fried vegetables, some hash browns, deep-fried lotus roots, a bowl of soup with boiled egg, and a few side dishes.

“Wow! They look very appetising. Lán Zhàn, did you cook all these dishes?”

“Yes,” Lán WàngJī replied.

“You really made all this for me? I’m so happy!”

Then, while devouring his breakfast, Wèi WúXiàn was praising Lán WàngJī for his cooking skills, and, alternately, he was asking him a series of questions.

“Lán Zhàn, what other dishes can you cook? Mmm, it’s really yummy, and they are all my favourites.”

“Lán Zhàn, when have you actually started to like me? And who confessed first? Ah! Of course, it was me. It had to be me.”

“Lán Zhàn, how long have we been living together? And why are you so well versed in bed?”

Lán WàngJī didn’t answer any of Wèi WúXiàn’s questions; instead, he asked, “Wèi Yīng, do you feel any change in your body?”

Wèi WúXiàn then said, “Ah! That’s right! Lán Zhàn, I formed a Golden Core.”

Then, while smiling, he took the end part of Lán WàngJī’s forehead ribbon and began to fidget with it.

“Just by playing with me only once, I was able to form a Golden Core,” he said. “Lán Zhàn, why are you so amazing? How about playing with me once more?”

Lán WàngJī, however, introduced another topic: “Wèi Yīng, is your body all right? Do you feel any discomfort?”

“Huh? Not at all. I’m fine,” replied Wèi WúXiàn. “Why are you asking about it? Are you worried that you might have injured me?”

Then, he added, “To be honest, your techniques are really good. I was fully satisfied.”

“When I woke up this morning, I examined your Golden Core vessel and noted that everything was perfectly fine, including your Golden Core,” said Lán WàngJī.

He went on, “Since you had not mentioned it earlier, I thought that you had not sensed the Golden Core at all. So, I was worried that something was wrong with the Golden Core.”

With a warm smile, Wèi WúXiàn said, “The Golden Core is not more important than you are to me. I first of all care about you, well, about us, I should say.”

Lán WàngJī was stunned and slowly repeating Wèi WúXiàn’s words in his head, “The Golden Core...is not more important...than you are to me.”

Then, he recalled what the doctor said after he had examined Wèi WúXiàn: “Wèi-gōngzǐ* triggered the self-explosion of the Golden Core in order to use the energy of the explosion to form a protection around his body.

<small>*gōngzǐ is an honorific title addressed to a son of a noble family.</small>

“Thus, Wèi-gōngzǐ survived the violent turmoil of the waves without major injuries.

“If a Golden Core breaks, no matter how big or small the fragments are, there’s still a possibility to repair it.

“However, a Golden Core that is shattered by activating its self-explosion might be impossible to repair, and also, it is unlikely that another Golden Core can be formed.

“An ordinary cultivator would never opt for such decisive measures. Wèi-gōngzǐ’s strong will to survive, his decision on the spot and his ability to endure pain are really remarkable and very different from ordinary people.”

Lán WàngJī thought, “I know what a Golden Core means to Wèi Yīng. However, he chose to give up on it with the risk of no longer being able to form another one.

"And, above all, knowing how painful you could feel if you activate the self-explosion of your Golden Core, still, Wèi Yīng decided to bear such extreme pain in order to survive and return by my side.

“In his decision, Wèi Yīng was certainly sure that I would find him, as well as find a way to restore his Golden Core.

“If I had failed to find him within seven days, then there would be no way of forming another Golden Core.”

Lán WàngJī then imagined what Wèi WúXiàn might have said while taking his decision, “Lán Zhàn, I won’t die. I won’t let you down and make you wait like last time.”

“I really want to be inside him right now,” Lán WàngJī thought, while looking at Wèi WúXiàn intensively. “All day yesterday, I had longed to hold him, feel his naked body against mine.

“However, it’s nothing compared to the desire I have right now. I want to tear his clothes off and penetrate deeply inside him, blending our bodies and souls.”

Puzzled by Lán WàngJī’s prolonged silence, Wèi WúXiàn, who was still eating his breakfast, asked without raising his head, “Lán Zhàn, why are you so quiet?”

Then, he looked at him, and, at once, Wèi WúXiàn was astonished by what he observed.

After his surprise had passed, Wèi WúXiàn stretched his leg towards Lán WàngJī, and, with his toes, he began to rub Lán WàngJī’s leg. He teasingly asked, “Lán Zhàn, are you a little bit... uh... horny right now?”

Lán WàngJī’s eyes were burning hot; he replied, “You have suggested it yourself.”

Wèi WúXiàn kept on invitingly rubbing Lán WàngJī’s leg, and, while smiling, he asked, “What did I say?”

In a hoarse voice, Lán WàngJī replied, “You said, ‘How about playing with me one more time?’” 

Wèi WúXiàn laughed heartily; then, he spread his arms towards Lán WàngJī, letting the latter know that he could carry him to the bed.

So, he did in a hurry, then, impatiently, he tore Wèi WúXiàn’s trousers off.

Wèi WúXiàn noted that this time Lán WàngJī was a little bit ruthless; he said, “Lán Zhàn, am I overthinking? Are you not becoming more rough after deflowering me? Argh!”

Wèi WúXiàn’s words often had such a powerful effect on Lán WàngJī by adding fuel to the fire.

Lán WàngJī had inserted his fingers inside Wèi WúXiàn’s hole, and, rapidly, he quickened the movements of his fingers. He asked, after biting Wèi WúXiàn’s lower lip, “Can I not be rough?”

“Ahaa... of course, you can. You can do whatever you want. However, you are not allowed to use that technique again, like yesterday... argh,” replied Wèi WúXiàn while he was moaning between his sentences.

“Which technique?” Lán WàngJī asked, and, at the time, he pulled out his fingers, then, fiercely, he inserted his manhood, which was already hard like a rock.

“Argh... Lán Zhàn... why do you have to be that ruthless and impatient?”

Taking both his hands, Lán WàngJī placed them above Wèi WúXiàn’s head; then, he intertwined his fingers with Wèi WúXiàn’s fingers, and then, feverishly, he began to move back and forth.

He then leaned close to Wèi WúXiàn’s ear; his warm breath was like a caress on his ear. He said while he kept on bumping, “Wèi Yīng, you are mine.”

“Argh... Lán Zhàn... I am completely yours.”

When he woke up, Wèi WúXiàn praised Lán WàngJī for his techniques in bed. However, he didn’t expect that, with the most simple position, Lán WàngJī could make him feel so extremely good; he said, “Argh... Ér Gege... it’s too deep.”

“How does it feel compared to last night?” asked Lán WàngJī.

Surprisingly, last night, Lán WàngJī didn’t go all the way down inside Wèi WúXiàn, as the latter thought.

“Wèi Yīng, relax a little bit.”

“Argh... but you’re moving too fast. What did you eat to have such stamina?”

Lán WàngJī progressively rose Wèi WúXiàn’s buttocks, hitting every inch inside of Wèi WúXiàn’s hole.

“Lán Zhàn is like an overlord right now, making me feel powerless and submissive,” thought Wèi WúXiàn.

This time, no special techniques were used; however, Wèi WúXiàn felt that he would faint if Lán WàngJī kept on moving at such a speed.
