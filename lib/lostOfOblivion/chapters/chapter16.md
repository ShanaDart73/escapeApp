For most of the day, Wèi WúXiàn was anxious about misinterpreting Lán WàngJī’s kindness towards him. However, it turned out that what he had taken earlier as his fantasy became true.

And, right now, he was pinned down on the bed and was kissed and fondled by Lán WàngJī. All this happened too fast for Wèi WúXiàn to cope with.

As a teenager, Wèi WúXiàn had read a lot of illustrated pornographic books; however, he never came across those that involved two men in a relationship.

On top of that, Lán WàngJī’s techniques in bed were exceedingly good, turning what he had learned from books to dust and leaving him without any other options but to lie down and be at the mercy of Lán WàngJī.

However, he was still ashamed to let Lán WàngJī notice his swollen and aching manhood. As Lán WàngJī’s hands slid down to his hips, Wèi WúXiàn knew it was only a matter of time before he found out.

Under the skilful touch of Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn bit his lip so as to stop himself from moaning; however, he could not prevent his toes from curling in pleasure, nor his feet from moving uncontrollably.

Before losing his memories, Wèi WúXiàn would not be subdued so easily, like he was now, lying down submissively and letting Lán WàngJī do as he pleased.

Now that, in his mind, Wèi WúXiàn was a teenager, Lán WàngJī found him so adorable as he tried his best to conceal his reaction, something that he wouldn’t normally do.

Lán WàngJī then slid his hand inside Wèi WúXiàn’s underwear and held his swollen manhood. As he did, Wèi WúXiàn let out a muttered moan.

“Wèi Yīng, don’t bite your lips,” said Lán WàngJī. Then, he put his fingers on Wèi WúXiàn’s lips and parted them, while his other hand stroked his private parts.

Then, from Wèi WúXiàn’s lips to his belly button, Lán WàngJī slowly covered this path with light kisses, and, when he reached the belly button, using the tip of his tongue, he licked his navel and around it.

Wèi WúXiàn then reached the state of ecstasy; he could no longer bear this excessive pleasure and called out his name, “Lán Zhàn.”

“Wèi Yīng, everything is all right,” said Lán WàngJī. Then he began to take off Wèi WúXiàn’s underwear.

Unconsciously, Wèi WúXiàn raised his hips so as to assist Lán WàngJī on his task. Then he felt ashamed of his action, but it was too late, because his swollen manhood was already on display for Lán WàngJī to admire.

However, Wèi WúXiàn could not help but close his legs tight.

Lán WàngJī thrust his knee between Wèi WúXiàn’s legs and opened them up; then, he wrapped his hand around his manhood and began to rub it up and down, introducing some variations by stroking the head with the palm of his hand in a circular motion and also by teasing the small opening with his finger.

Lán WàngJī knew all Wèi WúXiàn’s erogenous zones, and as for the latter, he felt so good that he thought he would die if it carried on like this, wondering why Lán WàngJī was so versed at it.

Then, suddenly, it occurred to him that he should not be the only one to feel good. Wèi WúXiàn sat up to remove Lán WàngJī’s nightclothes.

However, Lán WàngJī gently pushed him back on the bed and said, “Wèi Yīng, don’t move; just leave everything to me.”

So, Wèi WúXiàn did as he was told, letting Lán WàngJī lead the way.

Lán WàngJī then lowered his head and took him deeply into his mouth, and, “Aaah!” Wèi WúXiàn could not suppress a clear and loud moan.

“Lán Zhàn, you don’t need to do that.” Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body was trembling uncontrollably under such a surge of sexual pleasure.

Since Lán WàngJī was expecting Wèi WúXiàn to resist him, he pressed down on Wèi WúXiàn’s hips and legs so as to prevent him from wriggling while he performed fellatio on him.

Whenever Lán WàngJī wanted to take his manhood into his mouth, Wèi WúXiàn refused to let him do so. During their love squabble, Lán WàngJī loved watching him trying to resist but failing, trying to escape but never succeeding, and the way Wèi WúXiàn would finally surrender to him.

In the end, because Lán WàngJī’s strength was overwhelming for him to overcome, Wèi WúXiàn gave up struggling, feeling as though Lán WàngJī was sucking each area of his body.

Lán WàngJī’s mouth was wet and warm, which added a pleasurable feeling, as Lán WàngJī kept on sucking his manhood, as well as licking the head, and teasing the small opening with the tip of his tongue.

Wèi WúXiàn could not believe that the person who was at this instance fellating him was none other than Lán WàngJī. So, he closed his eyes tight since he didn’t dare to look at him.

The pleasure from his lower body was getting higher and higher; the sucking techniques of Lán WàngJī were so good that it became harder for Wèi WúXiàn to restrain himself from crying out loud, as well as from stopping the blood that kept on rushing into his private parts.

As Lán WàngJī deeply swallowed him, his throat contracted around the head of Wèi WúXiàn’s manhood. It felt so good that Wèi WúXiàn bit his fingers, which prevented him from moaning.

“If it carries on like this,” Wèi WúXiàn thought, “I will soon come inside Lán Zhàn’s mouth. I can’t do that to Lán Zhàn. I must not!”

In his despair, Wèi WúXiàn seemed to have found the salvation that would lessen his raging desire and calm the surge of blood that rushed into his manhood.

He began to recite the rules of GūsūLán:

<blockquote>
    <em>Do not rest until the end of the day.</em><br />
    <em>Do not keep sleeping once it’s dawn.</em><br />
    <em>Do not be a picky eater.</em><br />
    <em>Do not drink alcohol.</em><br />
    <em>Do not stand or sit incorrectly.</em><br />
    <em>Do not eat more than three bowls of rice a day...</em>
</blockquote>

Wèi WúXiàn remembered the rules that he had copied as a punishment, and, unintentionally, he ended up reciting them aloud.

Lán WàngJī then raised his head and said, “Wèi Yīng, you don’t need to recite our sect’s rules.”

However, Wèi WúXiàn refused to listen to Lán WàngJī. The latter understood that Wèi WúXiàn was about to come, but he didn’t want to release in his mouth, so Lán WàngJī used his hand to make him come.

As he at last ejaculated, Wèi WúXiàn gasped for breath, and his whole body quivered, and then, once it was done, he sat up.

“Lán Zhàn, I’ll help you, too,” he said.

However, Lán WàngJī, once more, pushed him back on the bed, and then, with his fingers, he collected Wèi WúXiàn’s white fluid, and gently, he began to rub the open Wèi WúXiàn’s anus, and then, slowly, he inserted a finger into it and carried on rubbing the inside of the tiny hole.

Like on their first time, even though he had guessed it, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Lán Zhàn, what did you put in?”

Lán WàngJī paused and asked, “Can I put mine in here?”

“What?” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, since he had thought that between men it was only about kissing, hugging and eventually helping each other release by using either a hand or mouth, just like what Lán WàngJī did to him.

Lán WàngJī resumed rubbing inside him, causing Wèi WúXiàn to feel a tickling sensation, then he said, “If you want to help me, let me put mine inside you.”

“You don’t need to ask; just do it,’ replied Wèi WúXiàn.

So, he let Lán WàngJī broaden his horizons, letting himself experience something completely new to him.

Lán WàngJī carried on rubbing inside Wèi WúXiàn, and, from time to time, he moved his finger in a circular motion, and then, in a low voice, he asked, “Are you all right?”

In addition to being pinned down, having Lán WàngJī’s finger inside him, and having to see his expression that seemed to say, ‘I understand that you know nothing about this, so I will teach you,’ Lán WàngJī’s question just added to his embarrassment.

“I’ve already said to you that you don’t need to ask me. It’s really embarrassing,” Wèi WúXiàn replied.

Lán WàngJī seemed to chuckle; then, inserting another finger, he found the P-spot and pressed on it.

“Aaah! Lán Zhàn!” Wèi WúXiàn moaned loudly, and he almost jumped off the bed, then he thought, “Why is there something like that inside a man’s body?”

Lán WàngJī began gently to rub the spot, which caused Wèi WúXiàn to twist his hips in order to escape.

“You said yourself that I don’t need to ask you.” said Lán WàngJī.

Wèi WúXiàn was defeated by his own words. So, he then stopped struggling and spread out his legs, surrendering himself to Lán WàngJī and letting him do as he pleased.

His submission was a delightful pleasure to Lán WàngJī. He became even more determined to make Wèi WúXiàn experience a far greater climax. He began to move his fingers up and down inside him, and then, he put in the third finger.

“Aaah!” Wèi WúXiàn let out a moan. With two fingers, it was already too much for him to bear; now that Lán WàngJī inserted the third one, he could not help but involuntarily tighten his buttocks and curl his toes.

“Wèi Yīng, try to relax,” said Lán WàngJī. Then, in order to let Wèi WúXiàn get used to it, he was now moving his fingers less deep inside him.

Anxious, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Lán Zhàn, is this really the way it is done? Are you not mistaken?”

With a smile on his face, Lán WàngJī replied, “Yes, I will show you.” Then, he pressed on the sensitive P-spot, which caused Wèi WúXiàn to reach another climax.

And then, Wèi WúXiàn spread his legs once more and said, “Come inside, then.”

“There is no need to hurry things up,” replied Lán WàngJī. Then, picking up a slow and regular rhythm, he carried on moving his fingers inside Wèi WúXiàn, rubbing his spot, massaging every area inside him so as to make the tiny hole loose a little bit.

Gradually, Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body relaxed, and it seemed to him that the inside of his hole was getting slippery.

Then, once more, Lán WàngJī covered Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body with light kisses, and the latter kept on moaning under each of his touches.

Embarrassed by all these moans, Wèi WúXiàn tried his best to restrain himself.
