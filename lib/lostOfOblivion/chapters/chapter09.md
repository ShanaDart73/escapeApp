“After you had destroyed the Tiger Talisman, you died.

“Seven years ago, Mò XuánYǔ, the illegitimate son of Jīn GuāngShàn*, summoned you by offering his own body.

<small>*Jīn GuāngShàn is the former leader of the LánlíngJīn sect and Jīn Líng’s grandfather.</small>

“However, people still consider you as an evil heretic, thinking that Lán WàngJī protects you because he is possessed by your evil spirit.

“Ever since you came back, you have been with Lán WàngJī day and night, doing everything together with him,” uttered Jiāng Chéng.

Then, Wèi WúXiàn turned towards Lán WàngJī and asked, “All this Jiāng Chéng just said, is it true?”

Lán WàngJī replied, “Yes.”

Then he thought, “Indeed, everything that was said is true, but the most important thing is left out. His account doesn’t contain all the facts.”

Wèi WúXiàn was stunned by those revelations; he went on thinking, “I have been with Lán Zhàn continuously, like two people living together. Moreover, people are still seeing me like a devil, and, in order to protect me, Lán Zhàn compromises himself.”

Then, aloud, he quickly said, “Jiāng Chéng, let’s go back for now. We’ll talk about it once we get home.”

Jiāng Chéng stared blankly at Wèi WúXiàn, and when he spoke, he sounded a bit hoarse, “You want to go back to Lotus Piers with me?!”

Wèi WúXiàn replied, “Yes, of course. We——”

At that instant, Wèi WúXiàn noticed Lán WàngJī’s expression and couldn’t finish his sentence. Such deep sorrow that he read on his face was unbearable.

Forgetting that Lán WàngJī once told him that he didn’t like physical contact, Wèi WúXiàn held Lán WàngJī’s hand, and, in haste, he said, “Lán Zhàn, why are you so sad? You look so dreadful. If you want me to stay, then I’ll stay with you. As for what happened during these past years, you can tell me about it later on.”

Jiāng Chéng then examined Lán WàngJī’s face; however, all he could see was the usual poker-faced expression that Lán WàngJī always wore on his face.

He thought, “How on earth did Wèi WúXiàn manage to see any sadness on Lán WàngJī’s face? Furthermore, I don’t see him looking dreadful at all.”

Turning towards Jiāng Chéng, Lán WàngJī said, “Leader Jiāng, may I have a word with you?”

Leaving the two of them in the pavilion, Wèi WúXiàn walked down the mountain path and stood at the same spot where Lán WàngJī was standing earlier.

Jiāng Chéng’s account was still running through his mind: “Lán Zhàn and I live together. People still hate me. So, Lán Zhàn protects me.

“Perhaps the reason why we live together is that some people want to kill me, so Lán Zhàn is protecting me day and night like a bodyguard. Lán Zhàn, why are you willing to go so far?”

Meanwhile, in the pavilion, Jiāng Chéng sneered, “HánGuāng-Jūn, you are so lucky. Although Wèi WúXiàn has lost his memories, he still likes you so much.”

Indifferent to Jiāng Chéng’s sarcasm, Lán WàngJī said, “Yes, indeed, I am lucky.”

Taken by surprise, Jiāng Chéng’s mouth was agape at Lán WàngJī’s remark.

Then, after a while, he asked, “Are you not going to tell him that you both are already married?”

“I have not as yet planned on telling him,” replied Lán WàngJī.

Jiāng Chéng resolved not to interfere in their marital matter. He then asked, “Why couldn’t I draw Suíbiàn?”

Lán WàngJī replied, “The properties of Wèi Yīng’s Golden Core have been modified.”

In a husky voice, Jiāng Chéng said, “Didn’t you say before that his Golden Core was shattered into pieces?”

“I had examined his Golden Core vessel yesterday and noted that there’s still a chance,” said Lán WàngJī.

Delighted, Jiāng Chéng asked, “There’s still a chance to reconstruct his Golden Core?”

Lán WàngJī replied, “The chance of rebuilding a Golden Core is within seven days. Four days have already passed since his Golden Core was damaged. There are still three days to reconstruct it.”

In one go, Jiāng Chéng eagerly asked multiple questions, “Are you sure of that? How can you be so certain about your diagnosis? And, more importantly, how did Wèi WúXiàn manage to form a Golden Core in the first place?”

Lán WàngJī remained silent for a while; then, he baldly replied, “Through the dual cultivation.”

Jiāng Chéng fell into stunned silence.

Then, he inwardly said, “I see. It is no wonder that his Golden Core’s properties have been changed.”

He then thought of what Lán WàngJī said before, “Lán WàngJī said that he had examined Wèi WúXiàn’s Golden Core vessel to see if it was possible to reconstruct his Golden Core.

“In other words, Wèi WúXiàn has been practising the dual cultivation with Lán WàngJī.” Jiāng Chéng kept on repeating this last sentence in his mind.

After a while, he sincerely said, “Thank you for all you have done for him.”

Ever since Wèi WúXiàn had returned, this was the first time that Jiāng Chéng spoke to Lán WàngJī without being sarcastic.

<br />&nbsp;
... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

As Lán WàngJī joined Wèi WúXiàn, the latter asked, “Where is Jiāng Chéng?”

“He has left,” replied Lán WàngJī.

After learning about the dual cultivation and being aware of what it implied, Jiāng Chéng felt awkward. He was so embarrassed that he knew that he wouldn’t be able to make eye contact with Wèi WúXiàn. Since he had other matters to attend to, he took it as an excuse to leave straight away.

Wèi WúXiàn said, “He left without saying goodbye. And what about Jīn Líng?”

“They left together,” replied Lán WàngJī.

“Oh! I almost forgot. Jīn Líng is also a sect leader,” said Wèi WúXiàn. Somehow, he could not help but feel disappointed for not seeing Jīn Líng one more time. He added, “I wanted to talk to him once more.”

Lán WàngJī said, “Jīn Líng will probably come again tomorrow.” Then he asked, “Wèi Yīng, do you want to see the rabbits?”

Surprised, Wèi WúXiàn said, “There are rabbits at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù!”

“Back then, you gave me two rabbits. Afterwards, I brought some more of them. Now, there are many rabbits living around here,” said Lán WàngJī.

With a smile, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, you really like rabbits.”

While he was waiting in the grove, Wèi WúXiàn gave some thought to all he had learned, “I have seen and been informed about people I care for the most. I really don’t care about other people or matters.

“And, since I will soon recover my memories, there’s no need of asking too many questions. I’ll just go with the flow.

“If Lán Zhàn wants to tell me about things I have forgotten, I’ll be all ears. On the other hand, if he doesn’t want to say anything, that’s all right by me.

“However, if it turns out that Lán Zhàn is compelled to protect me, I will find another place to stay.”

Following the white stone path, the two of them arrived at the meadow, where many fluffy white rabbits surrounded a big tree. Most of them were sleeping, while a few were moving around with their three pink petal-like noses and their long pinkish-white ears that they fluttered from time to time.

Amazed, Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “Wow! That’s quite a lot!”

Wakened by the sound of Wèi WúXiàn’s voice, the rabbits began to gather around Lán WàngJī; some were climbing on his white boots, others were running around him, making one wonder why they were so excited.

As they kept surrounding Lán WàngJī, some rabbits, standing on their hind legs, tried to climb further up on Lán WàngJī’s legs.

Lán WàngJī picked up a rabbit and held it in his arms. With his slender fingers, he gently scratched the chin of the rabbit.

In response to Lán WàngJī’s touch, the rabbit rested its long ears alongside its back and narrowed its ruby-like eyes into small slits, apparently very pleased by the stroke.

Wèi WúXiàn then caressed the head of the rabbit. However, the latter moved its head away from Wèi WúXiàn’s touch.

“Lán Zhàn, this rabbit avoids me. It doesn’t like me at all,” said Wèi WúXiàn.

Lán WàngJī handed the white rabbit to him. And, with a happy smile, Wèi WúXiàn took the rabbit into his arms.

Immediately, the rabbit began to toss and turn. Wèi WúXiàn tugged on its ears, and then, as he was about to scratch the rabbit’s belly, Lán WàngJī restrained his hand.

Interlacing his fingers with Wèi WúXiàn’s so as to form a hand of ten fingers, Lán WàngJī guided Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, and they both gently stroked the back of the fluffy rabbit.

Since he was accustomed to Lán WàngJī’s touch, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t find this physical contact unusual at all.

Shortly, the white rabbit stopped wriggling, rested peacefully in Wèi WúXiàn’s arms, and, once more, narrowed its eyes.

In a soft voice, Lán WàngJī said, “Look, it likes you.”

At that moment, a young boy, holding a basket, was coming towards them. The boy was wearing a GūsūLán uniform with a forehead ribbon without curl cloud motifs*.

<small>*Only the family members wear the ribbon with curl cloud motifs.</small>

Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, there is no need in letting many people know that you have lost your memories, since you will recover them soon.”

“All right,” agreed Wèi WúXiàn.

Presently, the youngster came closer and respectfully bowed to each of them in turn. “HánGuāng-Jūn. Wèi qiánbèi.”

Wèi WúXiàn caught a glimpse of carrots and cabbages inside the basket. While smiling, he remarked, “You came to feed the rabbits.”

“Yes,” the young boy replied. Then, he picked up some carrots and cabbages and handed them to Wèi WúXiàn.

Wèi WúXiàn took the vegetables and crouched down to feed the rabbits.

The young boy said, “Wèi qiánbèi, SīZhuī shīxiōng* said that you are doing fine now.”

<small>*shīxiōng means senior (male) in any kind of discipline (such as martial arts).</small>

“Yes. I’m all right,” replied Wèi WúXiàn.

“That’s great!” the boy said. Then, in a shy way, he added, “Wèi qiánbèi, we were really worried about you. Please, be more careful in the future.”

Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Am I not in good shape right now?”

“Will you ...” The boy seemed to hesitate, then asked, “For our next month’s exam, will you be able to come and supervise us?”

Wèi WúXiàn glanced at Lán WàngJī, and the latter nodded his head, then Wèi WúXiàn replied, “I’ll be there.”

The boy’s lips upturned into a smile. He then joyfully said, “We will work hard.”

Then, the two of them fed the rabbits until they emptied the basket. And then, the young boy bowed, picked up his basket, and off he went.
