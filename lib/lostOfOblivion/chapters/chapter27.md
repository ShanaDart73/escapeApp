Like in quiet meditation, Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn hugged each other in complete silence.

Wèi WúXiàn wandered his fingers on Lán WàngJī’s bare skin continuously. As he did so, he felt the body temperature of Lán WàngJī entering his own body through his fingers, and making his heart fill with joy.

He suddenly gained self-confidence, and said, “Earlier, while I was waiting for you, I was also thinking of a way that will help me regain my memories.

“Since I have now a Golden Core, and if I can remember some fragment of my lost memories, I can use that fragment as an anchor to penetrate into the realm of my unconscious mind.

“Once I enter, with the support of my Golden Core, I will be able to gather other fragments of my memories, which reside in the unconscious mind.

“Since memories are connected to each other, the more I recollect things the faster I will recover all my memories.”

“Have you thought it through?” Lán WàngJī asked.

“To be honest, I haven’t completely thought it over,” Wèi WúXiàn replied, “And, I still need to prepare myself first. Nonetheless, I have to face what had happened in the past.”

He went on after a short pause, “This morning, you helped me again strengthen my Golden Core via the dual cultivation. I have now begun to feel the result.

“For instance, about your scars, although I didn’t recall anything, however, I was able to sense something. Still, it will take long for my Golden Core to become more powerful.

“So, rather than waiting for my memories to return suddenly, or maybe they will return only partially, I prefer to use a method that will help me to recover them gradually.”

Lán WàngJī said, “If you want some help in recalling any fragment of your memories, you can ask me whatever you want to know.”

“I want to know about the rules of this room,” Wèi WúXiàn said, “I also found among other things  inside that box a scroll, in which Jingshi’s rules are written.

“There is a rule that I specifically want to know. It’s written in red as follows: ‘You are not allowed to use that technique on Wèi Yīng’.”

Lán WàngJī then slowly slid his hands from Wèi WúXiàn’s back down to his waist, and, without warning, he released his spiritual power through his fingers while he was stroking Wèi WúXiàn’s waist.

And, at the same time, he asked innocently, “Which technique are you talking about?”

“Argh...” Wèi WúXiàn could not help but let out a long moan, which was caused by the sudden sensation felt around his waist.

Then, he began to struggle in an attempt to set himself free from Lán WàngJī’s arms. However, in spite of his effort, he was unable to succeed, because Lán WàngJī held him tight, and didn’t want to let him go.

Furious, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, you went too far! I can’t believe it!”

Lán WàngJī then laughed. It seemed as though the room became suddenly more brighter because of his laughter.

He lowered his head, and covered Wèi WúXiàn’s lips in a deep kiss, sweeping away his anger, inserting his tongue deeply inside his mouth, and sucking all his breath.

Wèi WúXiàn’s anxiety over the past events finally settled down by Lán WàngJī’s kiss.

He could not remember how gruesome and painful their past was. However, he knew that sooner or later he had to face it.

Besides, the past events were a fait accompli. Whether he recalled them or not, they had already occurred, and there was nothing he could do to reverse or modify the outcome.

However, now that Lán WàngJī was by his side, holding him tight, and kissing him with passion, Wèi WúXiàn could tell that the present time was more cheerful.

After a long kiss, Lán WàngJī finally let go of his mouth, then, brought his own lips close to Wèi WúXiàn’s ear, he said, “I want you to come with me to see someone.”

Then, he took Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, and led him out of Jingshi.

Once outside, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Lán Zhàn, do we usually hold hands while walking at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù?”

“Occasionally,” replied Lán WàngJī.

Wèi WúXiàn said, “That’s right. Two grown-up men holding hands is a little bit weird.”

Then, despite what he just said, Wèi WúXiàn tightened his grip on Lán WàngJī’s hand.

Along the way, GūsūLán disciples were acting as usual, calm and undisturbed by the view of these two.

“What if your uncle sees us?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.

Lán WàngJī replied, “We try as much as possible not to let him see us like this.” Then, he added, “Nevertheless, it doesn’t matter if he sees us.”

Wèi WúXiàn felt warm inside by Lán WàngJī’s last words. Still, he thought that they should not let the uncle see them like this too often.

Then, he asked, “Lán Zhàn, who is that person you want me to see?”

Lán WàngJī only said, “Two days ago, I sent her an invitation letter to come to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù. However, it turned out that she is physically unfit to travel. Still, she managed to arrive here today.”

“Physically unfit to travel! Is that person very old?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.

“Do you want to know?”

“Yes, I do.”

“I won’t tell you,” said Lán WàngJī.

... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

As they stepped into the front yard of the Elegant Room, they saw a cute little girl pacing up and down in front of the entrance.

She was dressed in light crimson, wearing long braided hair, and had lovely eyes of purple grapes colour.

At the moment she saw Wèi WúXiàn, the little girl’s eyes lit up, then, she began to run towards him.

Her father chased after her, and, in low voice, he scolded her, “Mián-Mián, at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, you are not allowed to run.”

Then, Lín Ruì, Mián-Mián’s father, greeted them, “HánGuāng-Jūn and Mr Wèi.”

“HánGuāng-Jūn.” Mián-Mián also greeted.

Wèi WúXiàn returned the greeting to Lín Ruì, while wandering why the little girl ignored him.

Lín Ruì said to his daughter, “Mián-Mián, didn’t you see that Mr Wèi is also here?”

Then, the little girl was forced to greet Wèi WúXiàn, “Uncle Wèi.”

Wèi WúXiàn was a little bit disappointed; why the little girl used ‘uncle’ instead of ‘big brother’ to greet him.

Mián-Mián then said to him, “Come on, my mum is inside and waiting for you.”

Wèi WúXiàn got puzzled, he glanced at Lán WàngJī, and the latter nodded his head, letting him know that he had to go in and find out by himself.

When Wèi WúXiàn entered the Elegant Room, he saw a pregnant woman.

The belly of Luó QīngYáng*, Mián-Mián’s mother, was round and big, looking like a huge balloon.

<small>*Luó QīngYáng is the girl whom Wèi WúXiàn protected in Xuanwu Cave.</small>

Luó QīngYáng stood up as soon as she saw them, and, with a smile, she greeted them, “HánGuāng-Jūn and Wèi-gōngzǐ.”

She went on, “Wèi-gōngzǐ, I heard that you have temporarily lost your memories. Have you also forgotten about us?”

Wèi WúXiàn turned his head towards Lán WàngJī for help, then he noticed that the little girl was staring at him.

Suddenly, it came back to him, “Mián-Mián!” he exclaimed, “You are Mián-Mián?!”

Overexcited, Wèi WúXiàn went on, “So, now there are two Mián-Mián: a grown-up and a little Mián-Mián.”

Luó QīngYáng smiled, then replied, “That’s right. Mián-Mián is my nickname, and my name Qīngyáng. You should also memorise my name.”

“Your name is QīngYáng*,” uttered Wèi WúXiàn, “No wonder, back then, your friends called you Mián-Mián.”

<small>*The character of Yáng in QīngYáng is the same as in the characters for sheep (Miányáng), therefore, her friends nickname her Mián-Mián.</small>

Then, Wèi WúXiàn looked at her belly, and asked, “Which month of  pregnancy are you now?”

“I am eight months pregnant, and about to give birth to my second child.” replied Luó QīngYáng.

Mián-Mián said, “It’s my little brother.”

“Do you prefer a little brother or a little sister?” Wèi WúXiàn asked Mián-Mián.

Mián-Mián replied, “I prefer both. But this one is the little brother, and he has already a name.”

“Oh? What is his name?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.

“His name is YuǎnDào,” Lín Ruì replied, “Mián-Mián always wanted to have brothers and sisters to play with her.”

He went on, “Speaking of the name, Wèi-gōngzǐ, this name can be considered to be chosen by you.”

Wèi WúXiàn thought for a while, then remembered saying that his name was YuǎnDào to Mián-Mián, back then. He then exclaimed, “How dare you take it seriously?”

Lín Ruì said, “Back when you were teenagers, you have saved QīngYáng’s life, so it’s natural to be the one choosing the name for our child.”

“It was HánGuāng-Jūn who saved her, not me,” said Wèi WúXiàn.

“It’s all the same,” insisted Lín Ruì.

Wèi WúXiàn asked Mián-Mián, “Are you longing to have little brothers and sisters? Will you help out taking care of them? Do you know how to look after babies?”

“Of course, I do.” replied Mián-Mián, and gently hugged her mother’s belly, “All the babies do is eat and sleep.”

“How can it be so easy?” said Wèi WúXiàn.

Mián-Mián asked, “Do you mean that you have already taken care of a baby?”

“Of course, I have,” replied Wèi WúXiàn.

Then, with his hands, he showed how small Little Apple* was, and said, “I have taken care of a little baby girl of this size. She looks exactly like you when you were a baby.”

<small>*Little Apple is the name Wèi WúXiàn gives to the baby he saved.</small>

Luó QīngYáng chuckled, “Wèi-gōngzǐ, here you go again. How could you possibly know how Mián-Mián looked like when she was a baby?”

She then asked Lán WàngJī, “HánGuāng-Jūn, has Wèi-gōngzǐ really taken care of a baby?”

“Yes, he has,” replied Lán WàngJī, then told them the whole story of Little Apple, and afterwards, he sent someone to bring over the baby.

Deeply moved, Lín Ruì said, “Wèi-gōngzǐ is as always valiant.”

Then, suddenly, Mián-Mián happily said, “Mum, he just moved.”

“Your little brother is much more lively now because it’s the eight months of pregnancy,” said Luó QīngYáng to her daughter, “You were also like this.”

Wèi WúXiàn then became very curious about Luó QīngYáng’s pregnancy. After a while, however, he felt embarrassed by his staring at her belly.

Lín Ruì asked, “Second* Lady Lán, don’t you want to feel the foetal movement?”

<small>*Lín Ruì calls Wèi WúXiàn ‘Second Lady’ because Lán wangji, his husband, is the second son.</small>

Wèi WúXiàn was startled. He thought that the title of ‘Lady’ was a little bit weird for him. At the same time, he felt that it made sense, and could not find another suitable title.

Yes, indeed, he really wanted to feel Lín YuǎnDào’s activity.

He said inwardly, “Since I am the Second Lady Lán, then I should act like one. Therefore, there is no harm in feeling the foetal movement.”

Wèi WúXiàn then put his hand on Luó QīngYáng’s belly, and waited for a while. And then, he said, “The little Lín YuǎnDào fell asleep.”

Then, all of a sudden, he sensed at last two baby kicks. The baby’s movement seemed like a touch of a feather gently tickling his palm.

Wèi WúXiàn thought, “A tiny life is forming. It’s so sacred and wonderful.”
