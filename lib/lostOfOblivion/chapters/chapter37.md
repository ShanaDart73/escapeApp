Since Lán JǐngYí was drunk, Wèi WúXiàn asked the teenagers to stay in town for the night and return home the next day when Lán JǐngYí became sober. Otherwise, he would be punished by copying the GūsūLán rules.

Wèi WúXiàn then stepped on Suíbiàn and flew as fast as he could so as to reach Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù before curfew.

Holding a lantern, Lán WàngJī was standing in front of the gate, waiting for Wèi WúXiàn to return. And, as he saw him coming, his eyes lit up.

To welcome his Wèi Yīng, Lán WàngJī released from his fingertips some blue spiritual light in the form of butterflies, which, flapping delicately their wings, flew to meet Wèi WúXiàn, then moved in a circle around him as he was getting closer to his HánGuāng-Jūn.

Jumping off from his sword, Wèi WúXiàn’s heart was beating faster than ever, and his breathing also quickened up; he was no longer as calm as when he was travelling back home.

It was an overwhelming feeling for him to think that such a good-looking man belonged to him. Moreover, he was waiting for him to come home.

This was by far more precious to him than countless treasures in the world, and he was no longer afraid of other people trying to spoil his happiness.

Without saying a single word, both of them walked quickly towards each other to close the distance that separated them.

Then, surrounded by the blue butterflies, they hugged each other tight in front of the main entrance, and the sandalwood fragrance emanating from Lán WàngJī wrapped them up.

In a coquettish way, Wèi WúXiàn touched one of the two hanging parts of Lán WàngJī’s forehead ribbon, brought it in front by sliding his fingers slowly along the ribbon, and then rolled it around his index finger.

Teasingly, he said, “Èr-gēge, what’s wrong with you hugging me so tight after not seeing me for just one day? The disciples who are in charge of guarding the gate will see us.”

Lán WàngJī replied, “I have blocked you from their view.”

“Even though they can’t see me, do you think they won’t know what we are doing?” said Wèi WúXiàn, “HánGuāng-Jūn, since when did you become self-deceiving?”

“I am standing outside Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù,” said Lán WàngJī.

Since they were standing outside the GūsūLán residence, the rules of their sect were not applicable to them. And, in the past, Wèi WúXiàn had made use of this trick to avoid punishment.

Wèi WúXiàn said, “As the saying goes, one takes on the colour of one’s company. It seems like HánGuāng-Jūn gets influenced by Wèi WúXiàn.”

Lán WàngJī slightly frowned; then, earnestly, he looked at Wèi WúXiàn and said, “It’s true that being in good company will influence your behaviour. Wèi Yīng, you are not bad company to me.”

Wèi WúXiàn laughed.

Then, Lán WàngJī sensed a different smell of alcohol than that of Emperor Smile and asked, “Wèi Yīng, did you drink alcohol?”

“Yes, I did,” replies Wèi WúXiàn. “Today, I went to a remote village to get rid of evil spirits, and then, after that, I drank a lot of wine with the chief of the village.”

He then asked, “Did you smell it on my breath? Would you like to taste it?”

With a seductive look in his eyes, Wèi WúXiàn slightly bit his own lower lip with his pearl-like teeth, then, invitingly, he stuck out the tip of his tongue between his soft lips.

As a result, Lán WàngJī could not help his Adam’s apple to bob up and down. However, he restrained himself by kissing Wèi WúXiàn only slightly. And, when the latter pressed his own lips against his to deepen their kiss, Lán WàngJī drew back.

“I can’t let myself get drunk right now,” said Lán WàngJī. “I have prepared a gift for you, and I want to give it to you before getting drunk.”

“How do you know for sure that a deep kiss will get you drunk?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.

“Because the wine you drank is by far stronger than Emperor Smile,” replied Lán WàngJī.

“How can you tell?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.

Lán WàngJī replied, “Although I am not good at drinking, I learned more about the wines because you like to drink them so much.”

Wèi WúXiàn chuckled. Then, he stood on tiptoe and gave Lán WàngJī an affectionate kiss on the cheek.

A warm moonlight showered on them as they reached Jingshi. The magnolia tree was in full bloom with its white flowers. However, the fragrance of its blossoms was overpowered by the delicious smell of the food coming from the room.

Wèi WúXiàn quickly walked into the room and saw several dishes on the table, namely, spicy shrimp balls, Dong’an chicken, crabs in spicy sauce, and steamed fish head with chopped red pepper.

There were also some vegetable dishes such as fresh corn, bamboo shoots and lotus root. And, all these dishes were his favourite and were meticulously presented.

Wèi WúXiàn was overjoyed and said, “Èr-gēge, you are so amazing! This is so splendid! Is this table of delicious-looking dishes the gift you have prepared for me?”

Lán WàngJī slightly smiled, then replied, “Not at all.”

Then, he started to peel the crabs, while Wèi WúXiàn took a plate and filled it with various food, then presented it to Lán WàngJī.

He said, “Stop peeling the crabs; I’ll do it myself. You surely haven’t eaten yet. Let’s eat together.”

“Okay,” agreed Lán WàngJī.

He then put the crab meat he had already peeled into a plate and gave it to Wèi WúXiàn, and then, they started eating.

Wèi WúXiàn began to talk at length about what happened during their Night Hunting. And, from time to time, he would suddenly ask about the gift that Lán WàngJī mentioned earlier.

However, Lán WàngJī didn’t fall for Wèi WúXiàn’s stratagem, and, each time, he would reply either, “Don’t speak while eating,” or “We’ll talk about it after the dinner.”

In the end, Wèi WúXiàn gave up and focused on savouring every mouthful of the delicious food that Lán WàngJī cooked for him, while praising Lán WàngJī for each dish.

After the meal, the two of them went to the backyard. The sky above them was clear and filled with stars, the moonlight fell on the magnolia blossoms, and their surroundings were quiet and peaceful.

Lán WàngJī took out a velvet box from his sleeve, opened it and revealed a pure white bracelet with a knotted hair around it.

He said, “I did the same thing as you did before, putting my knotted hair around the bracelet.”

Then, he knelt down on one knee in front of Wèi WúXiàn and said, “Wèi Yīng, congratulations on forming a new Golden Core.”

Greatly touched, Wèi WúXiàn took the bracelet and wore it on his left wrist. Then, the two of them hugged each other tight.

“Lán Zhàn,” Wèi WúXiàn called in a very low and inviting voice, wanting to be carried to the bed.

So, Lán WàngJī did; he held him in his arms and walked into the room.
