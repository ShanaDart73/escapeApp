Wèi WúXiàn had fallen asleep soon after their lovemaking. When he woke up, it was already afternoon.

However, Lán WàngJī and he were not in a hurry to get out of bed. Moreover, they affectionately spooned together as they lay on the bed.

Lán WàngJī then told Wèi WúXiàn everything about their dual cultivation.

“Oh! No wonder why, after doing it with you, I sense that my spiritual power becomes stronger,” said Wèi WúXiàn.

He went on, “So, if I follow you correctly, you used your semen as a medium to pass through my spiritual barrier and penetrate my unconscious mind to help me restore my Golden Core.”

“Wow!” Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “I am really amazed to have come up with that method.”

Then, he turned to face Lán WàngJī and began to stroke his thighs. Lán WàngJī slightly patted the hand that fondled him.

Wèi WúXiàn then moved his hand up to Lán WàngJī’s chest and slid it under Lán WàngJī’s clothes. “Lán Zhàn, your muscles are really toned.”

Lán WàngJī then held the hand that moved about his chest, brought it to his lips, and tenderly kissed the back of Wèi WúXiàn’s hand.

Dissatisfied, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, I haven’t finished touching you.”

Lán WàngJī then kissed him passionately, sucking his tongue as well as his lower lip to the extent that it went numb.

Since last night, as Lán WàngJī had kissed him so many times, Wèi WúXiàn began to respond more actively.

Taking the initiative, Wèi WúXiàn deeply inserted his tongue into Lán WàngJī’s mouth, and then he continuously twisted his tongue around his.

Lán WàngJī, however, still held the lead; he kissed him to the point where Wèi WúXiàn felt that all his strength had deserted his body.

Still, Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, once more, slid underneath Lán WàngJī’s clothes and stroked his chest.

“Are you hungry?” asked Lán WàngJī as he sat up.

“I’m not really hungry,” Wèi WúXiàn replied. Then, enthusiastically, he asked, “Are you going to cook again?”

Lán WàngJī replied, “I can make something simple, since we don’t have enough time.”

“Can you make some plain noodle soup?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.

“Okay,” Lán WàngJī replied. Then, he kissed Wèi WúXiàn once more, got out of bed, picked up their clothes that were scattered on the floor, and hung them on the dressing screen.

Then, he went behind the dressing screen. When he came out, he was once again fully dressed and left the room.

Shortly after, he returned with two bowls of plain noodle soup.

Although it was a simple recipe, Lán WàngJī still made the dishes appealing in appearance.

Along with the noodles, he added slices of lotus root, shredded chicken, pickled mustard greens and fresh vegetables. All these toppings were nicely arranged inside the bowl.

The ingredients were similar to those he used for the breakfast; however, the flavour was completely different.

After eating the tasty noodle soup, Wèi WúXiàn was in merriment. “Lán Zhàn, I have been pondering about the channelling technique you told me. I think that it might be the cause of my amnesia.”

He went on, “As many memories reside in the conscious mind, any invasion could destabilise the host's mind.

“This issue must have slipped out of my attention. To be stable, a Golden Core vessel needs a lot of energy. Then the formation of the Golden Core comes after.

“However, I formed a Golden Core so suddenly, then, shortly after, I lost it. Meanwhile, the Golden Core vessel was still unstable; the realm of my conscious mind was also unstable; hence, the issue of memory loss arose.”

Lán WàngJī said, “When I found you, you had used the spiritual power to protect yourself, especially your head.

“Except for the injury on your leg, there were no other internal or external injuries. Therefore, the doctor could not find the cause of your amnesia.”

“Well, my reasoning is quite fair. Even though you have already used that kind of, oh...” Wèi WúXiàn paused.

Then, he suddenly smiled and winked at Lán WàngJī. “That kind of invading the conscious mind is likely to influence the host’s habits. Lán Zhàn, you are right about the channelling consequences.”

Wèi WúXiàn then held Lán WàngJī’s hand and said, “I have the feeling that you have been blaming yourself for not entering the realm of my unconscious mind earlier to help me form my Golden Core.

“But, Lán Zhàn, what he told me was right. Without repeatedly testing a new technique, carelessly using it could bear some serious consequences.

“This time I was lucky to lose only one part of my memories. What if I have lost all of my memories and am unable to recover them again?  Or, even worse, having a memory dysfunction, then what would become of me?”

He carried on, this time with a smile, “I think it was a good fortune that you had insisted on penetrating only my conscious mind and helped me open up the main points of my spiritual veins. Doing so, you have gradually let me get used to your spiritual power.

“If you had directly entered the realm of my unconscious mind, my spiritual veins and Golden Core vessel might not have coped with a surge of your spiritual power, which, in turn, could have caused another issue.”

Lán WàngJī remained silent while he got close to Wèi WúXiàn, embraced him in his arms, and rested his chin on Wèi WúXiàn’s head.

Then, he felt Wèi WúXiàn’s hand patting his back, like comforting a child.

Once more, Wèi WúXiàn held Lán WàngJī’s hand and placed it on his stomach, just below the belly button, then he said, “It is one thing to form a Golden Core, but another to solidify it.

“At this stage, we don’t fully understand the risks involved in our method. And other cultivators have their own way of forming a Golden Core.

“You have helped me build the foundation. From now on, I will rely on my own spiritual power to do the rest.”

Then, suddenly, Wèi WúXiàn laughed. “Lán Zhàn, the way I put your hand on my stomach, does it not look like I am pregnant with your child and letting you feel the baby’s movement?”

Finally, a smile seemed to have appeared on Lán WàngJī’s face; he replied, “It does.”

“Lán Zhàn, you are now playing along with my joking about. This is just unbelievable.”

“I have become accustomed to it,” Lán WàngJī replied, then he raised Wèi WúXiàn’s head and tenderly kissed him.

This time, Lán WàngJī took his time. He slowly licked Wèi WúXiàn’s lips, then he softly sucked them. His way of kissing him was like treasuring the most valuable possession he had.

As for Wèi WúXiàn, the kiss seemed to have some aphrodisiac effects on him.

Lán WàngJī’s kiss felt so good that, when he let go of his lips, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t want it to end just yet; he moved upward and fervently began to kiss Lán WàngJī.

After the kisses, Lán WàngJī said, “I’m going to inform Xiōng-zhǎng and the doctor that your Golden Core has been restored.”  Then he asked, “Wèi Yīng, will you come with me?”

“Of course, I’ll go with you,” he replied.

Wèi WúXiàn needed to change clothes since he was still wearing his nightclothes. So, Lán WàngJī went to the wardrobe, and, when he was about to take Wèi WúXiàn’s usual black clothes, he suddenly changed his mind.

Instead of Wèi WúXiàn’s black robes, Lán WàngJī took out a set of GūsūLán clan uniforms. The garments were not the formal ones, but still, they were not straightforward to be worn.

Wèi WúXiàn usually thought that wearing GūsūLán clothes meant keeping them clean at all times, which meant, according to him, not being able to move freely as you would wish to. Hence, he would rather wear black garments.

Although his black clothes were also embroidered with the curl cloud motifs of the GūsūLán clan, they were not as eye-catching as the white ones.

“Do I usually wear these kinds of clothes?” He asked, “They look very complex. I won’t be able to wear them properly.”

Lán WàngJī didn’t reply but only said, “I’ll help you put them on.”

He then did what he said, and, for the final touch, he wrapped the waist-belt around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist.

As he watched Lán WàngJī helping me, Wèi WúXiàn chuckled, and then he said, “Yesterday, I didn’t fasten the belt wrongly. You purposely said so to do it yourself.”

Lán WàngJī only said, “I’ll comb your hair.”

“You also wanted to comb my hair, didn’t you?” Wèi WúXiàn asked. Then he added, “If you don’t answer, I won’t let you comb my hair.”

Lán WàngJī’s ears turned pink; he finally replied, “Yes.”

“Lán Zhàn, why are you so cute?” he teasingly said.

Sitting in front of the mirror, Wèi WúXiàn looked at his appearance for a short while, then he said, “It looks like my face has changed a little bit compared to yesterday.”

“Yes,” Lán WàngJī agreed.

Because of the formation of his Golden Core, Wèi WúXiàn’s face slowly changed into his former appearance.

“Lán Zhàn, what do you like about me?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.

“I like everything about you,” he replied.

“Don’t you think that my previous face was more handsome than my current appearance?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.

Lán WàngJī replied, “Appearance is superficial.”

"Oh! I see," said Wèi WúXiàn. "Since you were a kid, you've looked at your handsome face in the mirror every day and thought that I’m not good-looking."

Lán WàngJī then said, “Wèi Yīng, you are handsome.” Then, he added, “I wish to be like you.”

Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “Ah! Lán Zhàn, your words become mind-blowing!”

Lán WàngJī didn’t really care about Wèi WúXiàn’s appearance.

However, after he finished tying up his hair in a ponytail and fastening the forehead ribbon, Lán WàngJī’s heart skipped a beat at how gorgeous Wèi WúXiàn looked in the GūsūLán clan uniform.
