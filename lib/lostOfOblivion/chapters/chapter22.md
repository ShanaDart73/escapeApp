Wèi WúXiàn had fallen asleep soon after their love-making. When he woke up, it was already afternoon.

However, Lán WàngJī and himself were not in hurry to get out of bed. Moreover, they affectionately spooned together as they lied on the bed.

Lán WàngJī then told Wèi WúXiàn everything about their dual cultivation.

“Oh! No wonder why after doing it with you, I sense that my spiritual power becomes more stronger,” said Wèi WúXiàn.

He went on, “So, if I followed correctly, you used your semen as a medium and passed through the spiritual veins barrier, then penetrated into my unconscious mind, and helped me restore my golden core.”

“Wow!” Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “I am really amazing to have come up with that method.”

Then, he turned to face Lán WàngJī, and began to stroke his thighs. Lán WàngJī slightly patted the hand that fondled him.

Wèi WúXiàn then moved his hand up to Lán WàngJī’s chest, and slid it under Lán WàngJī’s clothe, “Lán Zhàn, your muscles are really toned.”

Lán WàngJī then held the hand that moved about his chest, brought it to his lips, and tenderly kissed the back of Wèi WúXiàn’s hand.

Dissatisfied, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, I haven’t finished touching you.”

Lán WàngJī then kissed him passionately, sucking his tongue, as well as his lower lip to the extent that it went numb.

Meanwhile, since last night he had been kissed so many times, Wèi WúXiàn began to respond more actively.

And also, taking the initiative, he deeply inserted his tongue into Lán WàngJī’s mouth, then, continuously twisting his tongue around Lán WàngJī’s tongue.

Lán WàngJī, however, still held the lead, he kissed him to the point where Wèi WúXiàn felt that all his strength had deserted his body.

Still, Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, once more, slid underneath Lán WàngJī’s clothe and stroked his chest.

“Are you hungry?” asked Lán WàngJī as he sat up.

“I’m not really hungry,” Wèi WúXiàn replied. Then, enthusiastically, he asked, “Are you going to cook again?”

Lán WàngJī replied, “I can make something simple, since we don’t have enough time.”

“Can you make some plain noodle soup?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.

“Okay,” Lán WàngJī replied, then, he kissed Wèi WúXiàn once more, got out of bed, picked up their clothes that were scattered on the floor, and hanged them on the dressing screen.

Then, he went behind the dressing screen. When he came out, he was once again fully dressed, and left the room.

Shortly after, he returned with two bowls of plain noddle soup.

Even though it was a simple recipe, Lán WàngJī still made the dishes pleasing to the eye.

Besides noddles, he had added some slices of lotus root, shredded chicken, pickled mustard greens and fresh vegetables. All these toppings were nicely arranged inside the bowl.

The ingredients were similar to that of the breakfast, however, the flavour was completely different.

After eating the tasty noddle soup, Wèi WúXiàn was in high spirits, “Lán Zhàn, I have been pondering about the channelling technique that you told me. I think that it might be the cause of my amnesia.”

He went on, “Since there are many memories residing in the realm of the conscious mind, having another conscious mind penetrating inside might destabilise the conscious mind of the host.

“This issue must have slipped out of my attention, while the golden core vessel was accumulating a lot of energy in order to stabilise itself before the formation of the golden core.

“However, I formed a golden core so suddenly, then, shortly after, I lost it. Meanwhile, the golden core vessel was still unstable, the realm of my conscious mind was also unstable, hence, the issue of memory loss arose.”

Lán WàngJī said, “When I found you, you had used the spiritual power to protect yourself, especially your head.

“Except from the injury on your leg that you had before being washed away, there was no other internal or external injuries. Therefore, the doctor could not find the cause of your amnesia.”

“Well, my reasoning is quite fair. Even though you have already used that kind of, oh...” Wèi WúXiàn paused.

Then, he suddenly smiled and winked at Lán WàngJī, “That kind of invading the conscious mind is likely to influence the host’s habits. Lán Zhàn, you are right about the channelling consequences.”

Wèi WúXiàn then held Lán WàngJī’s hand, and said, “I have the feeling that you have been blaming yourself for not entering the realm of my unconscious mind earlier, in order to help me form my golden core.

“But, Lán Zhàn, what told me was right. Without repeatedly testing a new technique, and carelessly using it could bear some serious consequences.

“This time I was lucky to lose only one part of my memories. What if I have lost all of my memories, and unable to recover them again?  Or, even worst, having a memory dysfunction, then, what would become of me?”

He went on, this time, with a smile, “I think it was a good fortune that you had insisted on penetrating only the realm of my conscious mind, and help me open up the main points of my spiritual veins. Doing so, you have gradually let me get used to your spiritual power.

“If you had directly entered the realm of my unconscious mind, my spiritual veins and golden core vessel might have not coped with a surge of your spiritual power, which, in turn, could have caused another issues.”

Lán WàngJī remained silent, while he got close to Wèi WúXiàn, embraced him in his arms, and rested his chin on Wèi WúXiàn’s head.

Then, he felt Wèi WúXiàn’s hand patting his back, like comforting a child.

Wèi WúXiàn held Lán WàngJī’s hand again, and placed it on his stomach, just below the belly button, then, he said, “It is one thing to form a golden core, but another to solidify it.

“At this stage, we don’t fully understand the risks involved in our method. And other cultivators have their own way of forming a golden core.

“You have helped me build the foundation. To play it safe, from now on, I will rely on my own spiritual power to do the rest.”

Then, suddenly, Wèi WúXiàn laughed, “Lán Zhàn, the way I put your hand on my stomach, does it not look like I am pregnant of your child, and letting you feel the baby’s movement?”

Finally, a smile seemed to have appeared on Lán WàngJī’s face, he replied, “It does.”

“Lán Zhàn, you are now playing along with my joking about. This is just unbelievable.”

“I have become accustomed to it,” Lán WàngJī replied, then, he rose Wèi WúXiàn’s head and tenderly kissed him.

This time, Lán WàngJī took his time. He slowly licked Wèi WúXiàn’s lips, then, he softly sucked them. His way of kissing him was like treasuring the most valuable possession he had.

As for Wèi WúXiàn, the kiss seemed to have some aphrodisiac effects on him.

Lán WàngJī’s kiss felt so good that, when he let go of his lips, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t want it to end just yet, he moved upward and fervently began to kiss Lán WàngJī.

After the kisses, Lán WàngJī said, “I’m going to inform Xiōng-zhǎng and the doctor that your golden core has been restored.”  Then he asked, “Wèi Yīng, will you come with me?”

“Of course, I’ll go with you,” he replied.

Wèi WúXiàn needed to change clothes, since he was still wearing his nightclothes. So, Lán WàngJī went to the wardrobe, and, when he was about to take Wèi WúXiàn’s usual black clothes, he suddenly changed his mind.

Instead of Wèi WúXiàn’s black robes, Lán WàngJī took out a set of GūsūLán clan uniform. The garments were not the formal ones, but still, they were not easy to be worn.

Wèi WúXiàn usually thought that wearing GūsūLán clothes meant to keep them clean at all times, which meant, according to himself, not to be able to move freely as you would wish to. Hence, he would rather wear black garments.

Although his black clothes also had the curl cloud motifs of GūsūLán, still, they were not eye-catching.

“Do I usually wear these kind of clothes?” he asked, “They look very complex. I won’t be able to wear them properly.”

Lán WàngJī didn’t reply, but only said, “I’ll help you put them on.”

He then did what he said, and, for the final touch, he wrapped the waist-belt around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist.

As he watched Lán WàngJī helping me, Wèi WúXiàn chuckled, then, he said, “Yesterday, I didn’t fasten the belt wrongly. You purposely said so in order to do it yourself.”

Lán WàngJī only said, “I’ll comb your hair.”

“You also wanted to comb my hair, didn’t you?” Wèi WúXiàn asked. Then he added, “If you don’t answer, I won’t let you comb my hair.”

Lán WàngJī’s ears turned pink, he finally replied, “Yes.”

“Lán Zhàn, why are you so cute?” he teasingly said.

Sitting in front of the mirror, Wèi WúXiàn looked at his appearance for a short while, then, he said, “It looks like my face has changed a little bit compared to yesterday.”

“Yes,” Lán WàngJī agreed.

Because of the formation of his golden core, Wèi WúXiàn’s face slowly changed into his former appearance.

“Lán Zhàn, what do you like about me?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.

“I like everything about you,” he replied.

“Don’t you think that my previous face was more handsome than my current appearance?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.

Lán WàngJī replied, “Appearance is superficial.”

“Oh! I see,” said Wèi WúXiàn, “Since you were a kid, you look at your handsome face in the mirror every day, and think that I’m not good-looking.”

Lán WàngJī then said, “Wèi Yīng, you are handsome.” then, he added, “I wish to be like you.”

Extremely surprised, Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “Ah! Lán Zhàn, your words become jaw-dropping!”

Lán WàngJī didn’t really care about Wèi WúXiàn’s appearance.

However, when he finished tying up Wèi WúXiàn’s hair in ponytail, and fastening the forehead ribbon, Lán WàngJī’s heart skipped a beat by how gorgeous Wèi WúXiàn looked on GūsūLán clan uniform.
