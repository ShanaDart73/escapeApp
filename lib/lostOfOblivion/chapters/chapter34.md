While tossing up some peanuts one by one, which landed into his mouth, and having a smile on in his face, Wèi WúXiàn said, “So, in other words, it was you who spread those nonsense rumours about me.”

Jīn Líng’s face turned red with embarrassment.

This was the first time he earnestly admitted his mistake towards Wèi WúXiàn, and was remorseful for what he had done.

However, Jīn Líng didn’t expect Wèi WúXiàn to have an easygoing attitude on the matter; he reacted as if the rumours were not about him.

“I didn’t mean it,” said Jīn Líng.

“I know that, already,” kindly said Wèi WúXiàn.

For fun, Jīn Líng made-up stories about Yílíng Lǎozǔ, and most of them were easy to see that they were fake. So, Jīn Líng was certain that none would take them seriously.

One of his made-up stories was saying that Yílíng Lǎozǔ used his demonic power to transform his body, and give birth to HánGuāng-Jūn’s son.

However, whenever a story included the name of Yílíng Lǎozǔ, even if it sounded unlikely to be true, people would undeniably take it as truth.

So, from his made-up story born the rumours such as, in order to transform his body, Yílíng Lǎozǔ kidnapped hundreds of girls. Or, the reason why Yílíng Lǎozǔ gave birth to a son was that he wanted their child to seize the position of the next head of GūsūLán.

None of those people cared to check if Yílíng Lǎozǔ really gave birth to a son who would usurp the position of the head of the sect.

Since he had survived and crawled out of the burial mound, and became the master of the demonic power, therefore, he could also change into a woman, and give HánGuāng-Jūn a bunch of children.

Jīn Líng asked, “Why is it that as long as you are involved, no matter how implausible the rumour is, people will believe it?”

Wèi WúXiàn thought for a moment, then replied, “That’s because in their eyes I’m not a living person.”

Perplexed, Jīn Líng asked, “What do you mean by that?”

Wèi WúXiàn put his both hands on the back of his head, and lay on the grass with his legs crossed.

The sunlight was showering on him, making his face glow in the way that seemed illusory.

He slowly replied, “I am a symbol. A symbol of a devil. They don’t care about how I look like, or what I have achieved. However, they can’t live without using me as a topic of their gossips.

“After their tattles, they go back to their business, and none of them cares about me as a person.”

For those people, gossiping about Yílíng Lǎozǔ was part of their entertainment and recreation.

After satisfying their curiosity, dissipating their boredom, venting their disapproval, and establishing a moral superiority over Yílíng Lǎozǔ, everything was forgotten, and none of them was accountable for their gossips.

“What should we do, then?” asked Jīn Líng.

“There’s nothing we can do about it,” replied Wèi WúXiàn, “As I am a symbol in their eyes, are they not also a symbol in my eyes?

“Those people have nothing to do with me, so do I to them. Therefore, there’s no need to care about it.”

Wèi WúXiàn went on, “A-ling, sometimes if you don’t respond is also a response. Do you remember the case of MòlíngSū clan?”

“Yes I do,”replied Jīn Líng, “Last month, MòlíngSū clan accused GūsūLán of condoning your evil deeds. And also, there were rumours saying that GūsūLán had taken the MòlíngSū’s Night Hunting territory.”

“And, how did GūsūLán respond?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.

Jīn Líng thought for a moment, then replied, “GūsūLán paid no heed to their accusations.”

“That’s right,” said Wèi WúXiàn, “If GūsūLán had responded to them, I’m afraid that there would be endless back and fourth arguments between GūsūLán and MòlíngSū clan.”

A dispute between a larger clan and a smaller one, no matter what the outcome would be, people would regard GūsūLán and MòlíngSū clan as equal, which would lower GūsūLán’s status while raising the status of MòlíngSū clan.

Furthermore, no matter how you would deal with it, you would be accused of bullying the weak clan.

Wèi WúXiàn resumed, “So, it’s better to ignore them, and let those rumours fade away.

“Those, who gather and enjoy watching the show, will be disappointed if there is no show to watch, and will soon get bored, and, eventually, they will start to disperse.

“As for the rumours of the MòlíngSū’s Night Hunting territory, GūsūLán doesn’t need to seize it, and, this fact, everyone knows it.”

Jīn Líng then wondered, “Why do the rumours about GūsūLán don’t go out of control? Last month, people were gossiping about GūsūLán. But now, they’re no longer talking about it.”

“It’s probably because they still need GūsūLán to get rid of evil spirits and demons. Unlike me, who is a little bit inactive,” said Wèi WúXiàn.

“Besides,” he went on while smiling to himself, “for more than twenty years, I have gained notoriety for being a dreadful opponent, and it’s almost impossible to change it in people’s mind”

“It saddens you that you can’t change the way people see you?” Jīn Líng asked, then realised that it was a stupid question. With Wèi WúXiàn’s personality, he would certainly reply: “I don’t care”.

However, Wèi WúXiàn said, “What makes me sad is the fact that Lán Zhàn is also dragged into this mess.”  He looked a little bit down after saying that.

Jīn Líng had never seen Wèi WúXiàn looking depressed, so he didn’t know how to comfort him.

In a low voice, Jīn Líng said, “Right now, there is a lot of storybooks about HánGuāng-Jūn and you.”

“Yes, indeed.” Wèi WúXiàn let out a sigh.

In those stories, they changed his HánGuāng-Jūn from an awe-inspiring martial cultivator to an immoral character.

People behind those storybooks might or might not have malicious intentions. However, there was nothing he could do about it.

Even himself could not help but read one of those stories, which was titled ‘The Hooligan HánGuāng-Jūn Imprisons Yílíng Lǎozǔ’.

“It’s so awfully exciting to read it!” said Wèi WúXiàn inwardly, and he was no longer feeling down.

Then, he said, “Since Lán Zhàn said that he didn’t care what people are saying about him, then there is no longer a need for me to care about it, either.

“After all, they are just a bunch of insignificant people who spend their time spouting nonsense.”

Wèi WúXiàn only cared about his HánGuāng-Jūn. Likewise, Lán WàngJī also only cared about his Wèi Yīng. So, no matter how rampant the rumours were, both of them just carried on living their lovely life as a couple.

However, Jīn Líng was still unhappy about the matter, so Wèi WúXiàn gently patted his shoulder in a comforting manner, and said, “A-ling, you should always remember what people have done for you, and not what you have done for them.

“And you should not fill your mind with useless stuff, so that you can be free and happy. These are what my mother told me.”

“Your mother really told you that?” Jīn Líng asked.

“Of course,” replied Wèi WúXiàn, “Now, I passed it on to you.”

“You are preaching again,” muttered Jīn Líng.

Then, he turned his head to look at him. Wèi WúXiàn’s smiling eyes were shining like stars, and filled with sweetness.

Even though, occasionally, sadness appeared on his face, however, it swiftly swept away, and his usual cheerful expression reappeared.

“A-ling, it’s truly what my mother said,” reiterated Wèi WúXiàn. “I remember all your kindness and consideration towards me, and also what you have done for me.”

Jīn Líng suddenly blushed at Wèi WúXiàn’s words.

Wèi WúXiàn then stood up, and, gracefully, drew Suíbiàn. The red light wrapped around his sword was stunning.

With his red hair ribbon fluttering in the air, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Come on, young Zōng-zhǔ, stop thinking about all this matter, and let’s practise.”

Jīn Líng was still sitting on the grass, with the blushing expression that still lingered on his face. He just gazed vacantly at Wèi WúXiàn.

“This time, I won’t go easy on you,” said Wèi WúXiàn, “Are you up to it?”

Jīn Líng finally reacted and unsheathed Suìhuá, then proudly replied, “You bet! I won’t go easy on you, either.”

The two of them fiercely exchanged moves with their swords being wrapped in red light for Suíbiàn, and in golden light for Suìhuá.

When practising with Wèi WúXiàn, Jīn Líng always used the swordsmanship of the YúnmèngJiāng clan.

Their both swordsmanships came from YúnmèngJiāng clan, and, as they fought, the two didn’t look like they were from two different generations. They were looking more like brothers.
