“So, WàngJī,” said Lán XīChén, “to recap what you said, you have promised those people from Wěishàn Village that GūsūLán will pay for their losses if the authorities fail to compensate them on time?”

Lán XīChén placed the black piece that he was holding on the Go board, then he gracefully picked up the teacup and took a sip.

Lán WàngJī appeared to be completely absorbed in the Go game; still, he calmly replied, “Yes.”

Lán XīChén said, “Rumour has it that WúXiàn forced those people out of their village and destroyed their ancestral graveyard, that you condoned his behaviour and promised to compensate the villagers for all their losses.”

Wèi WúXiàn said, “Xiōng-zhǎng, I’d like to emphasise one point from what Lán Zhàn said. Although he gave his promise for the compensation, the village chief has already signed the compensatory agreement, and this was what the authorities wanted for a long time.

“So, relocating the villagers in order to divert the flood, as well as compensating them, are the authorities’ responsibilities.”

Lán XīChén then gently touched the folded copy of the compensation plan that was placed next to the Go board; he said, “The village chief has signed it. However, the nine committee members have not signed the compensatory agreement yet.”

“WúXiàn,” Lán XīChén looked at Wèi WúXiàn, and with a gentle tone, he went on, “Leader Jiāng dispatched someone to pick up a copy of the compensation plan from the authorities.

“And then, they printed more than one hundred thousand copies and distributed them all over the Yúnmèng territory.

“Leader Jiāng is deeply concerned about those rumours.”

In a low voice, Wèi WúXiàn said, “But no one will believe that those copies are from the original document.”

He then thought, “Such ingrained prejudice against me cannot be so easily corrected. With my notoriety, no matter what I say or do, people won’t trust me. Unfortunately, I have implicated Lán Zhàn in this matter.”

In a very kind tone, as if he were instructing a junior, Lán XīChén said, “The compensatory agreement is indeed incomplete, and there are some omissions.

“The authorities deliberately delay the payment and are unwilling to come forward to explain the situation. Moreover, people are more inclined to believe the rumours.”

Rumours are sensational; they are full of drama and excitement. Rumours are more fascinating than anything else for most people; they dispel their boredom.

<br />&nbsp;
... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

Meanwhile, those rumours continued to spread.

“So far, the GūsūLán sect has had an excellent reputation, and HánGuāng-Jūn has been famous for so long. Why not drag them down from their throne? Why not trample on them?

“If you can stand out from the crowd by pointing out others’ flaws and seeing through the whole conspiracy, then you’ll be able to make up a story and show that you are insightful, rational and objective.

“You can show that those upright cultivators are not different from common people.

“These kinds of rumours make common people feel happy.

“Being able to belittle those mighty cultivators will give you a sense of victory and superiority.

“Making jokes about the GūsūLán sect and exposing HánGuāng-Jūn’s true face will be very exciting for the passers-by.”

<br />&nbsp;
... ... ...
<br />&nbsp;

Lán WàngJī said, “Xiōng-zhǎng, it was my fault for not giving it a second thought before making that promise.”

Lán XīChén said, “It doesn’t matter. We’ll work out to find an alternative way to deal with this matter.”

He then added, “It’s only a hundred households; it’s not like GūsūLán can’t afford to pay the compensation.”

Indeed, for GūsūLán, it was not a significant sum of money; however, the matter ought not to be settled that way.

Wèi WúXiàn said, “I know that GūsūLán is wealthy, but——”

All of a sudden, Lán XīChén asked, “WúXiàn, do you have money?”

Wèi WúXiàn gulped.

Lán WàngJī hurriedly exclaimed, “Xiōng-zhǎng!”

Lán XīChén gently replied, “WàngJī, WúXiàn can also make some money.”

Then he went on, “WúXiàn, start making talismans for sale. An evil-repelling talisman made personally by Yílíng Lǎozǔ will certainly attract a lot of people wanting to buy it.”

Lán WàngJī cast a disappointing look at his elder brother.

Lán XīChén then smiled and said, “WàngJī and WúXiàn, I have been in seclusion for a long time, leaving both of you to take care of everything.

“Now that I have come out of seclusion, I will take full responsibility for this matter.”

Then, he said to his young brother, “WàngJī, just trust me.”

“All right,” said Lán WàngJī.

Then, after a short pause, he pointed out, “It was my fault for making that promise without knowing that the compensatory agreement was incomplete. Moreover, it never crossed my mind to check the compensation plan beforehand.

“However, before stepping in, Wèi Yīng was first required to see the copy of the compensation plan from drill instructor Zhāng.”

Lán WàngJī’s remark warmed Wèi WúXiàn’s heart.

Lán XīChén smiled and said, “I can easily guess that, because, WàngJī, since you were a kid, you’ve never had any notion of the use of money.”

Using the table of the Go game as a cover, Wèi WúXiàn sneakily moved his hand towards Lán WàngJī, and, with one finger, he tickled Lán WàngJī’s palm a few times.

As a result, Lán WàngJī’s ears turned slightly red, and he quickly took hold of Wèi WúXiàn’s hand to prevent him from fooling around.

Lán XīChén noticed Lán WàngJī’s expression and teasingly said, “The two of you, can you stop flirting in front of me?”

Wèi WúXiàn was startled and felt a little bit embarrassed. He wanted to pull his hand, but Lán WàngJī held it firmly; he didn’t want to let go of Wèi WúXiàn’s hand.

Lán XīChén could not conceal his amusement; he said, “WàngJī, you have really become bold.”

Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly said, “Xiōng-zhǎng, please, stop teasing him.”

“I won’t dare do that,” Lán XīChén said. “Besides, you are here to defend him.”

Wèi WúXiàn smiled and proudly said, “I will keep on defending him.”

He was now more at ease, and his worry, which he felt earlier about implicating Lán WàngJī, vanished into thin air.

“WúXiàn, I’d like to talk to you alone,” said Lán XīChén. “WàngJī, can you go to see the Third Uncle*? He has already compiled more than fifty percent of books on the history of the previous dynasty; he will need your assistance.”

<small>*Like in Lán WàngJī’s case, he is sometimes addressed as Lán Ér-gōngzǐ (second son of the Lán family); the same goes for uncles: second uncle, third uncle, etc.</small>

“Okay,” Lán WàngJī agreed.

He then pressed Wèi WúXiàn’s hand very gently before letting it go, which amused Lán XīChén even more.

As soon as Lán WàngJī left, Wèi WúXiàn said straight away, “Xiōng-zhǎng, I don’t want to pay for the compensation in place of the authorities.”

What is done is done. Wèi WúXiàn didn’t feel that he had done something wrong. So, naturally, he was unwilling to pay for it.

“WúXiàn, can you take WàngJī’s place and play this Go with me?” Lán XīChén said, “Don’t play your own style; use WàngJī’s style instead. I am keen to know how WàngJī would have solved this game.”

“Okay,” Wèi WúXiàn agreed.

He easily guessed the next move that Lán WàngJī would have made; he then picked up a white piece from its bowl and, calmly, placed it on the Go board.

Lán XīChén smiled and said, “WúXiàn, you said that you don’t want to pay for the compensation. What do you have in mind?”

Wèi WúXiàn said, “<em>If you repay evil with kindness, then how will you repay kindness?” *</em>

<small>*This old saying means rewarding people for poor behaviour will encourage them to act even worse in the future.</small>

“A sudden heavy rain turned residential areas into a river. If those villagers didn’t move out, they would be in danger.

“Xiōng-zhǎng, I don’t think that Lán Zhàn and I are at fault. So, why does GūsūLán have to bear the responsibility?

“The flood was a big threat for many residents living in downstream areas. If I had to choose again, I would still force them to move out.”

Lán XīChén said, “WúXiàn, do you really think that I want GūsūLán to pay for the compensation?

“If we pay for it, it will mean that GūsūLán admits that WàngJī and you are at fault.”

Surprised, Wèi WúXiàn uttered, “Xiōng-zhǎng, you didn’t have any intention of paying for the compensation?”

Lán XīChén smiled and restated what Wèi WúXiàn said, “<em>Repay evil with kindness; then how will you repay kindness?</em>

“WúXiàn, you are absolutely right. I also think that we should <em>repay evil with justice and kindness with kindness.</em>”

“Then, Xiōng-zhǎng, why do you want me to sell talismans for?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.

“WúXiàn, just think about it,” Lán XīChén said. “There were only a few villagers that have been relocated, so why are the rumours spreading so fast and all over Yúnmèng territory?

“Besides, Leader Jiāng would never let those rumours spread to such an extent.”

Wèi WúXiàn ventured, “Do you think that the authorities are behind all this?”

“What the authorities wish is not to have to pay for the compensation at all,” said Lán XīChén. “However, the fact that the prefect had issued a relocation order every early spring is their weak point; they can’t deny it. So, they would rather not have this matter spread around.

“WúXiàn, don’t you think that those villagers would first try to get the authorities to pay for the compensation instead of forcing GūsūLán to pay for it?”

Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Xiōng-zhǎng, what do you have in mind?”

“WúXiàn, you are very powerful,” said Lán XīChén. “It is said that Yílíng Lǎozǔ can defeat thousands of troops.

“Once someone’s strength is far more superior, it’s easy for people to guard themselves against you.”

Wèi WúXiàn stayed silent. He used to think that he was powerful; however, a tree that stands in the wood can be destroyed by the wind.

No matter how powerful he was, he could not protect people he wanted to protect so much. He was not strong enough to fight against the world.

And, right now, he was still not strong enough to defend his beloved ones against the pervasive malice that was looming out there.

Lán XīChén smiled at him and said, “WúXiàn, you are powerful, and the GūsūLán sect is not weak either. Since WàngJī and you are already a married couple, you should rely more on GūsūLán, your family.

“You have grown up a lot compared to what you used to be. Wangji and you should feel free to do what you want to do. I believe that you can do whatever you like without breaking the rules.

“Since GūsūLán has accepted you as Wangji’s partner and recorded you into the family registration, we can protect not only the you of now but also the you of the past and the you of the future.”

“I’ve got ahead of myself this time,” said Wèi WúXiàn, a little bit embarrassed.
