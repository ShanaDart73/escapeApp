        <b>Translator Note:</b>
        <p>Modaozushi (The Founder of Demonic Cultivation) is Mo Xiong Tong Xiu's masterpiece that has inspired many authors to write side stories. As a big fan of Modaozushi, this story has caught my attention because Hua Guan Xiu Wei, the author, keeps the same spirit of the original work.</p>
        <p>The title of this story when translated into English doesn't make much sense. So I call it 'Lost of Oblivion' because, in this story, Wèi WúXiàn loses his happy memories spent with Lán WàngJī, yet, as oblivious as he was of his own feelings towards Lán WàngJī back when they were teenagers, this time, however, he becomes aware of it, and I find his awareness so cute that I decide to give the story this title.</p>

“Wèi qiánbèi*,” cried Yú XiǎoShān, overwhelming with remorse.

<small>*qiánbèi: a title addressed to someone older than oneself.</small>

Three hours ago, Yú XiǎoShān was assigned along with other teenagers to check the performance of the Requiem spell, which was cast on the Red Maple slope.

Then, they would fly on their swords to patrol all the areas of the upper reaches of Han River.

However, right now, Wèi WúXiàn spotted a pitch dark pond that they had overlooked. On close inspection, it was hard to determine the depth of the pond.

At the centre, bubbles were constantly rising to the surface, like boiling water. However, when they actually touched the water, it felt icy-cold, like freezing water of a harsh winter.

Wèi WúXiàn smiled, and said, “Lán Zhàn, this promises to be interesting.”

All teenagers understood that there was a need to investigate the pond. So, full of energy, the disciples of the YúnmèngJiāng sect* were already gearing up to dive in. Each of them wanted to show their swimming skills to the teenagers of the GūsūLán clan*.

<small>*‘sect’ term refers to all members of the sect, while ‘clan’ term refers to only blood-related members of the family that owns the sect.</small>

Yú XiǎoShān was the eldest grandson of the MéishānYú clan. Since he was a child, he had an outstanding spiritual power and extraordinary talent. Furthermore, he was highly praised when he was studying at Lotus Pier*.

<small>*Lotus Pier is the name of the residence of the YúnmèngJiāng sect.</small>

He was the first to put forward his proposal, he said, “Wèi qiánbèi, I am good at swimming. May I take the lead?”

Wèi WúXiàn smiled, and said, “Okay. But you have to be careful. This pond is a little bit weird.”

Yú XiǎoShān was young, lacking good judgement. The more he was told to be careful, the less he cared.

Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng*, I will dive with them because the water is too cold. However, Lán Yù and Lán Héng are not good at swimming. So, they will stay with you here, on the bank.”

<small>*Wèi Yīng: Yīng is the “first” name given from birth (same goes for Zhàn in Lán Zhàn), while WúXiàn and WàngJī are given later on.</small>

Wèi WúXiàn said, “Okay.”

To prevent them from freezing to death, each teenager wrapped their whole body with their spiritual power.

Impatient to show off, Yú XiǎoShān went ahead and dived in.

Fast and agile, Yú XiǎoShān was swimming like a fish. And, on his way down, he noticed that the water was undisturbed. He also observed some small fish swimming about, but he didn’t detect anything unusual.

Yú XiǎoShān said to himself, “There is nothing special about this pond.” Then, he sped up his pace, and, soon after, he saw the bubbles streaming upwards, and decided to follow their source.

At the bottom of the pond, Yú XiǎoShān found a stout and magnificent stone pillar. And, on the surface of the pillar, there was a huge spiral pattern.

Following closely behind, Lán WàngJī also saw the stone pillar. He gestured at the rest of the teenagers to surround the pillar.

Worried that the disciples of the GūsūLán clan would outstrip him, Yú XiǎoShān picked up speed towards the base of the stone pillar.

However, upon reaching the bottom, his field of vision was blocked by a few long grey “ribbons”.

Those “ribbons” were floating in front of Yú XiǎoShān, occasionally, tickling his face.

Before Lán WàngJī could stop him, Yú XiǎoShān impulsively grabbed the “ribbons” and pulled them hard.

Suddenly, a very big pair of eyes like two huge lanterns appeared in front of him.

These enormous eyes were so bright that they illuminated the bottom of the pond, while being frightening at the same time.

It turned out that the spiral pattern was in fact the body of a colossal beast. This creature had coiled itself upside down around the stone pillar. And, it was its beard that Yú XiǎoShān pulled, causing it to wake up from its sleep.

And then, a very loud and furious roar stormed, sending strong vibrations, which almost damaged everyone’s eardrums.

The roar of the beast caused the water of the pond to be in turmoil. And, this commotion struck fear into everyone's heart.

"Get out of water! Quick!"

Like having the devil at their heels, everyone at once began to swim upwards.

One by one, Lán WàngJī led the teenagers to emerge from the water. And, for a while, there was a rush of the youngsters surfacing one after another.

Once out of the water, each teenager summoned their sword, and flew to the bank.

Meanwhile, the colossal beast kept on stirring the water, turning the centre of the pond into a huge vortex.

Lán Qí, a teenager from GūsūLán clan, who had just stepped on his sword, but hadn’t the time to steady himself, was caught in the vortex.

“Lán Qí!” cried out Wèi WúXiàn in terror.

At that instant, a bright blue light swept in the air. Lán WàngJī was already next to Lán Qí, picked him up, and flew to the bank.

Yú XiǎoShān, who had swum deeper than others, fell behind. As he surfaced and got on his sword, he felt a threatening presence behind him, and he couldn’t help but turn his head.

He saw a camel-like head, two deer-like horns, a snake-like neck, eagle-like claws, and a body fully covered with carp-like scales. The best had an embedded pearl on its chin, a long grey beard, and some upward scales on its throat.

He also observed a huge pair of golden eyes fiercely staring at him.

It was a young dragon! A young dragon that would soon become a fully fledged dragon.

The young dragon opened its dreadful mouth, and, like a tsunami, it launched itself towards Yú XiǎoShān.

Yú XiǎoShān was helplessly looking at the young dragon that would soon devour him. He was so terrified that he could no longer move. His legs began to wobble, almost causing him to fall off from his sword.

Suddenly, from the corner of his eye, he noticed a flash of red light. He didn’t have the time to react that, in the very next instant, he was thrust towards the bank by Wèi WúXiàn.

To fly as fast as he could, Wèi WúXiàn used all his spiritual power. Now, he felt exhausted. Furthermore, since there was no more spiritual power left to feed his sword, Wèi WúXiàn could no longer make Suíbiàn* move.

<small>*Suíbiàn is the name of Wèi WúXiàn’s sword.</small>
The open mouth of the young dragon was getting closer, and, not only Wèi WúXiàn could see its sharp teeth and blood-red tongue, but also his field of vision was filled with its monstrous mouth.

Wèi WúXiàn could even smell the stench of rotten meat reeking from its mouth; the smell of death.

He thought, “This is not the first time I am facing death.”

“Wèi Yīng!”

As soon as this well-known voice to him reached his ears, instantly, the owner of that voice occupied Wèi WúXiàn’s mind completely.

His voice, which was always gentle and calm, now sounded like a white crane crying out in pain.

To hear such a great distress in his voice hurt Wèi WúXiàn’s heart profoundly.

Then, time seemed to stand still, and, although this vast world was populated, at that instant, the world became an empty place, except for only that person.

Wèi WúXiàn’s heart began to beat rapidly. He then sensed a flow of spiritual power rushing through his veins.

“Lán Zhàn!” said to himself while clenching his fists tight, “Lán Zhàn is worried about me. I must not die!”

He suddenly smiled.

His smile was so bright that it eclipsed the sun.

And, for a split second, it seemed to Lán WàngJī that he once more saw the invincible opponent in the battle of Jiānglíng, when thousands of Wēn sect’s cultivators had surrounded him However, none of them could get close to him.

Wèi WúXiàn was standing in the middle of the fierce* corpses, which were under his command. His untied hair was fluttering in the wind. And, the melodious sound of his flute was like played by a celestial being.

<small>*The term ‘fierce’ is used to describe a corpse with a strong resentment, hence the corpse is invincible.</small>
Back then, Wèi WúXiàn had the same smile on his face, arrogantly glancing at his opponents, looking down upon the world, everything was under his control.

Wèi WúXiàn boldly said, “So what if you’ll soon turn into a fully fledged dragon. Who do you think you are to make Lán Zhàn feel so sad.”

In an instant, there was a very warm sensation in his abdomen, then his whole body was filled with vigorous spiritual power.

The red light of Suíbiàn became brighter, and, like a shooting star, Suíbiàn dashed towards the bank, covering several yards in the blink of an eye.

Lán WàngJī, who had also rushed towards him, hugged Wèi WúXiàn in the air, holding him tight, he flew to the bank.

The young dragon didn’t chase after them. It just hovered over the pond, quietly watching them, the mortal beings, while exhaling white fumes through its nostrils.

Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn stood side by side on the bank, fearlessly looking at the young dragon, and defiantly pointing their swords towards it.

After a little while, it appeared as though the young dragon felt that fighting with those humans was beneath its dignity. It disdainfully wagged its tail, then flew away.

As soon as the young dragon had gone, dark clouds began to appear in the sky. In the next instant, the sky was completely covered with the rolling gloomy clouds.

Then, suddenly, lightning streaked through the clouds, soon followed by a loud sound of the thunder. And then, a heavy rain abruptly began to pour down.

In no time, they were all drenched to the skin.

Wèi WúXiàn’s wet fringe stuck on his forehead, while rainwater was sliding down his cheeks.

“Lán Zhàn,” he called, turning his head towards Lán WàngJī, and was instantly shocked to see the white parts of Lán WàngJī’s eyes had turned red. It was a terrible sight.

Wèi WúXiàn’s heart was in pain. He then smiled, and said; “I was really scared. So, hurry up and soothe m——”

He hadn’t even finished his sentence that Lán WàngJī abruptly pulled him into his arms, and covered his mouth in a deep kiss.

The sandalwood fragrance of Lán WàngJī also wrapped around Wèi WúXiàn.

Wèi WúXiàn was so fervently kissed that he felt his whole body becoming feeble. Furthermore, Lán WàngJī was holding him so tight that his upper body began to hurt.

Putting his hands against Lán WàngJī’s chest, Wèi WúXiàn tried his best to break free. Then, gasping for breath, he said, “Wait! We are in front of kids.”

Paying no heed to Wèi WúXiàn’s attempt, Lán WàngJī put one hand on the back of Wèi WúXiàn’s head, and vigorously pulled him back into his arms, while his other hand clapped on Wèi WúXiàn’s buttocks firmly, he turned around.

With his back, Lán WàngJī put Wèi WúXiàn out of sight of the teenagers, who were so shocked that their jaws dropped open.

Wèi WúXiàn moaned in pain. However, this time, he didn’t dare to struggle. Instead, he submissively wrapped his arms around Lán WàngJī’s neck, and let him give vent to his distress.

Lán WàngJī’s kisses were like a tornado, causing havoc wherever it passed. Biting Wèi WúXiàn’s lower lip as though he wanted to tear it off. Sucking his tongue to the point that Wèi WúXiàn began to feel the base of his tongue going numb.

Gradually, Wèi WúXiàn was getting close to losing his consciousness. His arms began to slide down from Lán WàngJī’s neck. And, before he could pass out, Lán WàngJī finally let go of his mouth.

Still holding Wèi WúXiàn tight, Lán WàngJī let him rest his head on his chest, while turning his own head, and quietly looking at the teenagers. His ears became red with embarrassment.

At the moment they saw Lán WàngJī turning his head towards them, some YúnmèngJiāng sect’s disciples hurriedly turned around to avoid eye contact. Lán SīZhuī blindfolded Lán JǐngYí with his hands, while closing his own eyes tight.

Wèi WúXiàn pressed his forehead against Lán WàngJī’s chin, wrapped his arms around him, and gave him a few pats on the back to comfort him.

They peacefully hugged each other for a while.

Then, Wèi WúXiàn slightly raised his head, and pecked Lán WàngJī on the cheek. He tenderly said, “Lán Zhàn, I formed a golden core*.”

<small>*Golden core is the source of the spiritual energy.</small>
