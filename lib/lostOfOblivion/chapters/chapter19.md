After releasing his white fluid, Wèi WúXiàn fell into state of languor, and Lán WàngJī, while he was still inside him, began the process of dual cultivation.

Since, after losing a golden core, a new one could be formed within seven days, and there were still three days left, since Wèi WúXiàn went missing for two days, and was in a coma for another two days, Lán WàngJī decided to perform the dual cultivation without further delay.

However, to begin the process of dual cultivation, Lán WàngJī needed to penetrate into the realm of Wèi WúXiàn’s conscious mind. Once inside, he began to channel through it using his spiritual power.

While channelling, Lán WàngJī could see in Wèi WúXiàn’s memories a series of images of what happened around Wèi WúXiàn since he woke up this morning, as well as the people he met and told to, including himself.

Entering the realm of the conscious mind was similar to the empathy, where you invited the spirit of a deceased person to enter your body in order to penetrate into their memory.

Once the spirit of the dead was inside you, you would be able to hear what they heard, observe what they saw, and feel what they felt. This process helped in discovering information that only the deceased person knew about it.

Although both, empathy and channelling, were similar, however, the process of a spirit entering your body was much easier compared to the process of penetrating into the realm of someone’s conscious mind.

This was because the deceased people no longer possessed the spiritual veins*.

<small>*In Chinese martial arts, spiritual veins, also known as meridians, are believed to be the paths in which the life-energy known as Qi flows. In this story, Qi is the spiritual power.</small>

Inside the living beings, spiritual veins forged a barrier that protected the realm of the conscious mind, hence, preventing anyone from invading other people’s mind. Even for ordinary people with low spiritual power, their conscious minds were also protected.

However, with his brilliant mind, Wèi WúXiàn succeeded in finding an easy method to enter the realm of the conscious mind, where other cultivators before him had tried but failed.

He had found out that during the intercourse, people became defenceless due to the intense pleasure. So, at that crucial moment, using the semen as the medium, they could overcome that barrier, and penetrate into the realm of the conscious mind to perform the channelling.

This process also required the one who wanted to penetrate into the other’s conscious mind to enter their own conscious mind first.

Once you were inside the realm of your partner’s conscious mind, and began to channel, you would be able to detect the most important paths of the spiritual veins.

Beyond the realm of the conscious mind was the realm of the unconscious mind.

If you channelled deeper and penetrated into the realm of your partner’s unconscious mind, you would be able to discover their deepest desire, even modify their habits.

If you were a high-level cultivator, you would be to control the flow of your partner’s spiritual power, which streamed through the spiritual veins.

However, to be able to gain access to the realm of the unconscious mind required your partner to have an absolute trust in you, otherwise, you would be rejected, instinctively.

Before Wèi WúXiàn went missing, while they were performing the dual cultivation, Lán WàngJī was able to see the flow of Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual power through his spiritual veins, without entering the realm of Wèi WúXiàn’s unconscious mind.

This was because the level of Lán WàngJī’s cultivation was the most powerful. And also, the using of his semen was not only to pass through the barrier, but also to help them blend together their conscious minds.

Since Wèi WúXiàn did no longer have his golden core, which generated a high amount of the spiritual power, Wèi WúXiàn’s current spiritual power became as weak as an ordinary person.

So, after spotting the flow of Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual power, Lán WàngJī used his own spiritual power to guide the flow through the spiritual veins.

He also opened up the main paths of Wèi WúXiàn ‘s spiritual veins. Hence, the whole process took less effort to be completed.

After the channelling, Lán WàngJī was certain that in near future, a golden core would begin to form inside Wèi WúXiàn’s golden core vessel, that there was no need to enter his unconscious mind.

During the channelling, Lán WàngJī saw himself in the memories of Wèi WúXiàn, when, one evening, both of them were in Jingshi, and he was reading a book aloud for Wèi WúXiàn. It was Wèi WúXiàn’s favourite story. When he finished, he told him to go to bed since Wèi WúXiàn became sleepy.

After that channelling, Lán WàngJī found out that Wèi WúXiàn’s usual sleeping time had changed, as well as his favourite sentence of the story.

Lán WàngJī believed that he was the one who caused these changes during the channelling, because his spiritual power was much stronger than that of Wèi WúXiàn, and, as a result, he tampered with Wèi WúXiàn’s habits.

Since channelling through the realm of the unconscious mind could allowed one to alter the other’s wishes and habits, Lán WàngJī didn’t want these kind of things to happen to Wèi WúXiàn.

Therefore, during their dual cultivation, they always operated in the realm of the conscious mind, and, step by step, they worked together to accomplish their goal.

However, Wèi WúXiàn was not as cautious as Lán WàngJī was, he said, “Èr-gēge*, I trust you. So, you can go deeper and enter the realm of my unconscious mind. In that way, you’ll be able to accelerate the whole process.”

<small>*Since ‘Second Brother’ sounds weird in English language, from now on Èr-gēge will be used instead. The correct pronunciation of Èr-gēge is on the sidebar.</small>

Seeing that Lán WàngJī was not happy about his suggestion, Wèi WúXiàn did not insist.

He then put his arms around Lán WàngJī’s neck, and, in a coquettish way, he said, “Èr-gēge, don’t worry. It’s fine if you don’t want to do it. Just help me open up the main paths of my spiritual veins, I’ll do the rest. I promise that I’ll work hard to strengthen my foundation.”

However, after Wèi WúXiàn went missing, Lán WàngJī blamed himself for being so cautious at that time. If only he had listened to Wèi WúXiàn, and entered his unconscious mind to help him quickly form a golden core, and solidify it, Wèi WúXiàn’s life would not be at stake.

On that day, when he had traced Wèi WúXiàn’s signal-transmitter talisman, and only found Suíbiàn with the baby girl, for a moment, his mind went blank. Instinctively, he knew that something had happened to Wèi WúXiàn.

And, during those two days of searching him, Lán WàngJī had tried hard to focus his spiritual power on WàngJī, despite being in constant agony.

Somehow, he was sure that Wèi WúXiàn was still alive, but he was afraid that it would take long to find him, just like last time.

Lán WàngJī knew that he would not bear to spend another long periods of waiting for him to return. So, from now on, he would not let him be out of his sight again, and keep protecting him day and night.

At the time he was found, his Wèi Yīng was chilled to the bone, the same Wèi Yīng whom he pampered every day, and kept him warm every time he felt cold. But, for two days, his Wèi Yīng was soaked in the cold river without him being by his side to keep him warm.

Lán WàngJī swore to make up for it. And also, he decided that from now on, he would listen to him, and let him do whatever it pleased him to do.
