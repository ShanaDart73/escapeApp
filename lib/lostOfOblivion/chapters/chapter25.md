Indeed, Lán WàngJī could no longer restrain his emotion, bumping hard and hitting Wèi WúXiàn’s weak spot, causing a turmoil inside his hole.

“Wèi Yīng, how much do you remember of the GūsūLán rules? Recite them,” said Lán WàngJī.

“What?! Right now?” Wèi WúXiàn was really annoyed. “Yesterday, when I was reciting the rules, you stopped me from doing so. And now, you want me to recite them!”

Then he asked, “Are you sure that you really want to hear me reciting the rules while we are doing it and still wearing the GūsūLán uniforms?”

In a dominant tone, Lán WàngJī said, “Recite the GūsūLán rules.”

Then, he gripped Wèi WúXiàn’s buttocks so hard that his fingers sank into the flesh. Meanwhile, he kept on moving back and forth.

“Aaah...” While moaning, Wèi WúXiàn cried out, “Don’t go so deep!”

Since Wèi WúXiàn still had not started to recite the rules, Lán WàngJī gave him a slap on his buttocks.

“Ah!” surprised, Wèi WúXiàn thought, “Did Lán Zhàn slap me or give me a pat? It was so gentle that I’m not sure which one it was.”

In a deep voice, Lán WàngJī said, “Hurry up! Recite the rules. I know that you can recall them.”

“Aargh... even though I had recited some rules yesterday, right now, however, I can’t remember them at all,” Wèi WúXiàn replied.

Lán WàngJī then gave him another slap. And, this time, Wèi WúXiàn was sure that it was not a pat.

“Lán Zhàn, why are you slapping me?” Wèi WúXiàn’s voice sounded erotic due to the overwhelming pleasure he felt.

“If I stop slapping you, will you recite the GūsūLán rules?” Lán WàngJī asked.

“Aaah... how am I supposed to remember the rules when you are bumping me so hard?” Wèi WúXiàn complained.

Then he went on, “How about you recite a few rules to help me remember them?”

Lán WàngJī’s ears suddenly turned red; he just realised that he was unable to recite the rules while he was making love to Wèi WúXiàn.

“Try to remember them by yourself,” Lán WàngJī thundered. Then he added, “If you don’t recite the rules, you will be punished.”

Putting his words into action, Lán WàngJī pulled his manhood so as to position the head midway out around the opening of Wèi WúXiàn’s hole and was ready to give the punishment.

Having Lán WàngJī’s huge stuff not moving inside him was more unbearable for Wèi WúXiàn than when he got pounded hard. So, he had no other choice but to try hard to recollect the few rules from yesterday.

He began, “The Buddhist scriptures teach, ‘You have to be honest and respectful, cautious with your words and deeds, always having a moral conduct.’”

Unexpectedly, Wèi WúXiàn recited the most elaborate scripture. And it turned out that he was right about reciting the rules while they were making love, because it came as a blow to Lán WàngJī.

He wanted Wèi WúXiàn to recite the rules; however, he could not bear to hear him reciting the scriptures.

Unaware of the change in Lán WàngJī’s mood, Wèi WúXiàn carried on reciting the scriptures.

Then, all of a sudden, Lán WàngJī thrust his manhood inside Wèi WúXiàn’s hole.

“Haaah... Lán Zhàn!” Wèi WúXiàn cried, “What are you doing?”

Lán WàngJī calmly said, “Don’t recite the Buddhist scriptures. Just recite the maxims.”

“Are both of them not parts of the GūsūLán rules? I can’t tell which is which,” Wèi WúXiàn argued.

Lán WàngJī then hit hard on Wèi WúXiàn’s P-spot. “Wèi Yīng, you are not allowed to recite the Buddhist scriptures. You can only recite the maxims. If you don’t, you’re going to be punished again.”

“But which ones are maxims?” thought Wèi WúXiàn.

Meanwhile, Lán WàngJī kept on bumping him hard, causing his head to spin a little bit.

Wèi WúXiàn’s mind was in a mess; nevertheless, he managed to recollect some rules and recite them: “Killing and stealing are forbidden.”

Listening to Wèi WúXiàn, Lán WàngJī was, on one hand, very moved that he had recalled the maxims, and, on the other hand, it got him so overexcited that he felt the urge to pound him even harder.

As he did so, Wèi WúXiàn was no longer in the state of recollecting any maxims.

“Aaah... Èr-gēge, I can’t remember the rest of the rules. Please, have mercy on me. Argh... Don’t hit that place so hard.”

Noting that Wèi WúXiàn couldn’t any longer remember the maxims, Lán WàngJī, in a coaxing voice, said, “Wèi Yīng, think carefully.”

“Haaah... I will think... I’m going to think carefully. So, please, stop hitting that spot. I can’t bear this sensation any longer.”

Lán WàngJī, however, didn’t stop hitting his weak spot; instead, he carried on bumping Wèi WúXiàn harder.

The sound of their lovemaking filled the whole room.

Wèi WúXiàn’s hole tightened around Lán WàngJī’s manhood. He was feeling so good that it seemed to him that his bones were getting weaker.

As a result, it was getting harder for him to keep on supporting his upper body with his elbows, which were resting on the dressing table.

Lán WàngJī was now looking at Wèi WúXiàn with his cheeks turned rosy and his eyes filled with lust. He was completely immersed in an intense sexual desire, with his mind full of naughty thoughts.

As he couldn't remember other maxims, Wèi WúXiàn eventually gave up, “Lán Zhàn, HánGuāng-Jūn, I don’t recall the rest of the maxims. So, please, don’t bump me so hard.”

Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, if you don’t carry on reciting the rules, you will receive a punishment.”

Wèi WúXiàn replied, “I accept the punishment—old-fashioned boy. You can punish me.”

Then, Lán WàngJī said, “Count every thrust until one hundred.”

“Why are you so mean! Aaah! Be gentle,” Wèi WúXiàn protested.

Once more, Lán WàngJī pulled out his whole hot stuff, and then he placed the head on the opening of the hole.

Without warning, he thrust his hot stuff deeply inside Wèi WúXiàn’s hole. Then, he counted, “One,” and went on, “Count the rest by yourself.”

The sudden thrust almost brought tears to Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes. However, since he had accepted to be punished, he could only comply and began to count, “Two... three… four... aaah... five... aargh...”

Unlike his first thrust, Lán WàngJī’s back and forth movements were more gentle. However, each time he hit the weak spot, it was enough to cause Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body to quiver.

After each of his thrusts, Lán WàngJī was pausing to allow Wèi WúXiàn to catch his breath and keep on counting.

Lán WàngJī’s back-and-forth movements produced some white foam. As he kept on thrusting, he made the foam move in and out of Wèi WúXiàn’s hole.

After counting up to eighty, Wèi WúXiàn could no longer carry on counting. Furthermore, as his strength failed him, his knees slid off the stool, and his upper body collapsed on the dressing table.

Lán WàngJī then stopped moving, and, in a gentle voice, he said, “Wèi Yīng, raise your head, and let me see your face in the mirror.”

Wèi WúXiàn somehow managed to raise his head. The corners of his eyes wore the trace of tears, and his face was covered with droplets of sweat. He was looking exhausted, and yet, at the same time, enticing.

Lán WàngJī chuckled. He then carried Wèi WúXiàn and made him sit on the dressing table.

And then, he put Wèi WúXiàn’s arms around his neck, spread Wèi WúXiàn’s legs so as to have a full view of his open hole, and, once more, he penetrated him.

The inside of Wèi WúXiàn was warm and slippery and continuously throbbing due to the overwhelming pleasure.

Lán WàngJī then coaxed him, “Wèi Yīng, it’s only twenty thrusts to go; how about we finish counting them?”

A brief memory of both of them kneeling in front of the ancestral hall and receiving a punishment crossed Wèi WúXiàn’s mind.

Somehow, this flashback appeared to him as their first worship*, and that they had already formed ties back then.

<small>*In a traditional Chinese wedding ceremony, newlyweds kowtow three times: to the heavens and earth, to their parents and to each other.</small>

He also remembered that back then Lán WàngJī used to punish him.

With his arms weakly wrapped around Lán WàngJī’s neck, Wèi WúXiàn asked while whimpering, “Ér Gege, why do you always punish me?”

This time, Lán WàngJī laughed out loud, his beautiful lips turned into a large smile, and some light shone in his eyes like a sea of stars.

All of these wonders made Wèi WúXiàn’s heart beat fast.

Charmed by this unparalleled beauty, Wèi WúXiàn tightened his hug around Lán WàngJī’s neck, then he said, “Lán Zhàn, you can resume your punishment.”

Lán WàngJī licked Wèi WúXiàn’s ear, then he softly kissed it, and then, in his deep voice, he asked, “Will you carry on counting?”

“Yes, I will,” replied Wèi WúXiàn.

Lán WàngJī rewarded him with a kiss on his lips.

Then, with Wèi WúXiàn’s legs resting in the crook of his arms, Lán WàngJī slowly moved back, and then, he thrust with great strength.

“Aaah! So ruthless!” cried Wèi WúXiàn.

After only a few times of being bumped hard, Wèi WúXiàn could no longer carry on counting.

While he was still moving fiercely back and forth, Lán WàngJī asked, “Wèi Yīng, are you still counting? What is the count up to now?”

Wèi WúXiàn shook his head left and right while moaning; he slightly pushed Lán WàngJī on the shoulders to make him stop for a moment.

However, Lán WàngJī ignored his demand and carried on at the same pace, making Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body quiver with pleasure.

“Darling, I can’t keep up! Please, have mercy on me.” Wèi WúXiàn was crying so beautifully that his appearance invoked the image of a pear blossom under the droplets of the rain.

He was also shaking his head and scratching Lán WàngJī’s shoulders.

“Wèi Yīng, I will stop when you finish counting,” said Lán WàngJī.

Somehow, Wèi WúXiàn managed to ask, “Eighty-eight?”

While he was enjoying the view of Wèi WúXiàn trembling under the overwhelming pleasure that he gave, Lán WàngJī nodded. Then, he softened his thrusts.

“Eighty-nine… ninety…” Wèi WúXiàn resumed counting.

Since Wèi WúXiàn was back on track, Lán WàngJī brought Wèi WúXiàn’s legs closer together, then he began to pound hard once again, causing Wèi WúXiàn’s voice to sound shaky.

“Ninety-five… aa…” Between his moans, Wèi WúXiàn tried hard to keep on counting.

Lán WàngJī smiled.

Then, he poured a shower of light kisses on his crying face. However, he didn’t show mercy while he kept on moving his lower body.

He said between his kisses, “You got the count wrong. Receive your punishment.”

And then, he kindly corrected him, “It’s ninety-one.”

Having no other options, Wèi WúXiàn carried on, “Ninety-two...”

Then, Lán WàngJī made a much more powerful thrust, causing Wèi WúXiàn to shoot out a jet of the white fluid.

Being thrown into a dazing state, Wèi WúXiàn moaned and uttered, “Argh... ninety-seven...”

Extremely pleased with the desired outcome, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you got the count wrong again. Start over.”

“What?!” Wèi WúXiàn thought that he had heard it wrong.

“I said you made a mistake in counting. Restart from the beginning,” Lán WàngJī replied with a smile on his face.

Wèi WúXiàn shook his head so frenetically that his long hair spread over his shoulders. There were only a few counts left to reach one hundred.

“Lán Zhàn, you did it on purpose,” protested Wèi WúXiàn.

“Yes, I did it on purpose,” admitted Lán WàngJī. “I was teasing you.”

Then, he gave Wèi WúXiàn another shower of kisses, filled with tenderness, all over his face.

As he kissed him, Wèi WúXiàn felt Lán WàngJī’s warm breath caressing his face. This display of love warmed his heart.

Lán WàngJī then said, “Wèi Yīng, it’s you who said that I can do whatever I want.”

“Lán Zhàn truly loves me,” thought Wèi WúXiàn. “And he looks so happy.”

Wèi WúXiàn could not help but spread out his trembling legs a bit more. As he did so, the liquid produced inside his hole slid down between his buttocks.

Lán WàngJī was pleased by Wèi WúXiàn’s invitation. He then asked in a gentle voice, “Wèi Yīng, can you carry on counting?”

Wèi WúXiàn slightly shook his head as a reply; his fair-skinned and beautiful face wore the trace of tears.

“Lán Zhàn is going to punish me again.” Wèi WúXiàn thought, “Whatever he wants me to do, I will do it.”

Lán WàngJī then took off Wèi WúXiàn’s forehead ribbon, and then he tied Wèi WúXiàn’s mouth so as to prevent him from speaking or making a sound.

He wrapped the white ribbon three times around Wèi WúXiàn’s slightly open mouth. The forehead ribbon was quickly soaked around his mouth.

With his hands on Lán WàngJī’s shoulders, Wèi WúXiàn wanted to push him away, and yet, he welcomed him instead. However, in his gleaming eyes, one could read his pleading.

Wèi WúXiàn wanted to say, “Be gentle, Èr-gēge. You can do whatever you want, but, please, be gentle.” However, his mouth was sealed.

In one hand, Lán WàngJī held Wèi WúXiàn’s manhood; then, using his thumb, he blocked the small opening.

With a smile that didn’t convey any mercy, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, bite the ribbon tight; I’m going to begin bullying you.”
