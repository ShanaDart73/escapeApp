After a short moment, the door slid open, and Wèi WúXiàn walked out from the room, wearing white, cloud-patterned robes.

His black long hair was tied low, at the back of the next, with a white ribbon. Upon a closer look, his hair was actually fastened with GūsūLán forehead ribbon.

“Young Leader Jīn, did you come to see me?” said Wèi WúXiàn with a bright smile of his face.

Then, he turned towards Jiāng Chéng and said, while still smiling, “Leader Jiāng is also here.”

Jīn Líng had never heard Wèi WúXiàn talking to Jiāng Chéng in such a teasing and casual way.

Jiāng Chéng was also surprised. Then, he remembered what Lán WàngJī said earlier: ‘he will only recall the recent events’.

He had remembered something, but not everything, at least for the time being. Therefore, his attitude was still friendly.

This friendliness, however, would last only for one day. After today, it wouldn’t happen again.

Jīn Líng looked at Wèi WúXiàn and seemed to be puzzled, he asked, “Why do you look slightly different? Your appearance seems to have changed a little bit.”

“I’ve become more handsome, right?” remarked Wèi WúXiàn.

Jīn Líng replied, “It’s strange. You’re not looking like yourself. You have actually become good-looking, just like the appearance of our Jīn family.”

At first glance, Jiāng Chéng failed to notice it, because GūsūLán clothes on Wèi WúXiàn was really eye-catching.

Only then, after Jīn Líng’s remark, he realised that Wèi WúXiàn’s appearance became more like his former one.

Also, it turned out to be the face that was engraved deeply in Jiāng Chéng’s memory.

Jiāng Chéng then thought, “No wonder Jīn Líng thinks that it’s strange. It is indeed extraordinary.”

At that moment, Lán WàngJī came out of the room, and joined them on the table. He brought along an exquisite tea set, and began to pour the tea into the cups for everyone, while keeping an elegant posture.

It was the white peony tea, which was always abundant in Jīnlíntái, and was Jīn Líng’s favourite tea.

Jiāng Chéng thought, “He has chosen this tea only for Jīn Líng’s sake.” Then, he tried hard to suppress the disappointing feeling in him.

With a complaining voice, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, Jīn Líng said that my appearance now is strange.”

Lán WàngJī simply replied, “Since you have now a golden core, your face ought to be similar to the one of your original self.”

“Have you really formed a golden core?” Jīn Líng asked.

Wèi WúXiàn replied, “Of course, I have.”

Then, to show that he had a golden core, Wèi WúXiàn began to produce a red spiritual light that gathered in the palm of his hand. Once completed, it looked like a red ball set on fire, and undulated like a flame.

Jiāng Chéng and Jīn Líng noticed that, for someone who newly formed a golden core, Wèi WúXiàn had a strong spiritual power and a solid foundation.

However, Jīn Líng said, “Your spiritual power is feeble, not really impressive.”

Wèi WúXiàn laughed, then said, “Of course, I can’t compete against you, the young leader of LánlíngJīn sect. I will only last two or three hundred moves, if I fight a duel with the young leader.”

“You will last at most one hundred moves,” Jīn Líng exclaimed, “If Xiānzǐ fights along with me, then, it will be at most then moves.”

Wèi WúXiàn was about to ask who Xiānzǐ was, when he recalled that it was Jīn Líng’s spiritual dog, he said, “If we exchange moves, it is a duel between you and me only. Why will you feel the need of calling Xiānzǐ into our fight?”

Unhappy, Jīn Líng said, “You remember that Xiānzǐ is my spiritual dog. You indeed recall many things.”

“I only recall a few memories,” corrected Wèi WúXiàn.

He only saw the memories that Lán WàngJī let him see in the incense burner.

Before diving into the realm of his unconscious mind to gather the fragments of his memories, Wèi WúXiàn planned on entering the dream once again, tonight.

Last night, he only saw the good memories. Tonight, he had to work hard to recall the bad memories, too.

So, Jiāng Chéng’s assumption was incorrect, because Wèi WúXiàn didn’t remember all the events that happened after he came back.

Jiāng Chéng then asked, “There won’t be any unforeseen issue with the golden core, right?”

“No, there won’t,” Lán WàngJī replied, “His golden core is completely stable.”

Jīn Líng said, “You should stay at home to recover and strengthen you body. Don’t go out wandering around, again.”

Wèi WúXiàn smiled, and said, “Thank you so much, Young Leader Jīn, for your advice.” Then he turned towards Jiāng Chéng, “Leader Jiāng, thank you for your concern.”

Here we go again with his teasing way of talking and friendly attitude.

Jiāng Chéng could not tell how he felt for being treated so kindly by Wèi WúXiàn. He didn’t allow himself to be a person who liked to reminisce about the old days.

Wèi WúXiàn then carried on showing Jīn Líng how he could control the flow of his spiritual power.

Through his fingertips, he released some red spiritual strings as thin as a thread of silk. Then, progressively, these strings coiled to form a bud of a flower.

And then, gracefully, that flower bud bloomed, the petals, one by one, slowly opened up.

“This is exactly what he used to do to attract girls, when he was a teenager,” thought Jiāng Chéng, “This guy, after getting a golden core, starts to show off.”

Jiāng Chéng then remarked, “You used to like flaunting your swordsmanship in front of people.”

“That’s because I was a kid. Who can stay young forever,” protested Wèi WúXiàn.

He turned into a kid after forming a golden core. And, from now on, he could perform his swordplay only for Lán WàngJī.

Now that Wèi WúXiàn had a new golden core, Jiāng Chéng felt like a heavy burden had been removed from his shoulders, he thought, “I no longer own him anything.”

Then, from his sleeve, he took out a purple box, placed it on the table, and, in a lukewarm tone, he said, “This is your congratulation gift for forming a golden core.”

“Jiāng Chéng, you’re too kind,” said Wèi WúXiàn, then, with a smile, he took the box, and opened it.

The gift was a pair of magnificent pendants with a lotus design on them. Each pendant had a tassel attached to the end, and the two tassels had different colours, a purple and a blue.

As a matter of fact, Jiāng Chéng’s gift was more suitable for the wedding, to congratulate the couple for getting married.

However, at their wedding ceremony, Jiāng Chéng felt uneasy to give a wedding gift, so he chose another gilt, instead. And, together with Jīn Líng, they gave their gifts to the couple.

Although Jiāng Chéng’s gift back then was priceless, however, it was not meant to wish a good marriage to the couple.

“HánGuāng-Jūn is from Lán* family, so I chose a blue tassel for him.” said Jiāng Chéng.

<small>*Lán means blue colour.</small>

The colour of the tassel should have been pink for the bride. However, Lán WàngJī was male, so it was awkward to give him a pendant with a pink tassel.

Wèi WúXiàn said inwardly, “Jiāng Chéng is really thoughtful for choosing a blue tassel for Lán Zhàn, and a purple one for me.”

“Jiāng Chéng, you are indeed wise and sensible. Thank you,” said Wèi WúXiàn with a lovely smile on his face.

Then, he took out the pendant with the blue tassel from the box, and, wanting to see how it would look like on Lán WàngJī, he placed the pendant against Lán WàngJī’s waist, while he was still holding it, and, without even realising it, he leaned on Lán WàngJī.

Wèi WúXiàn’s natural behaviour caused Jiāng Chéng to shiver. The latter then coughed to clear his voice, “Be more discreet. Don’t just throw yourself into his arms with that face of yours.”

“What’s wrong with my face?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.

Jiāng Chéng replied, “Your face is not suitable for a cut-sleeve*. I had barely got used to that pretty face you had before.”

<small>*cut-sleeve is a term that means male homosexual.</small>

With indifference, Wèi WúXiàn shrugged his shoulders, and said, “Leader Jiāng, please do get used to this face as soon as possible, because I can’t restrain myself in front of Lán Zhàn.”

Then, he resumed his little activity around Lán WàngJī’s waist.

Jiāng Chéng then said, “You guys can just wear the pendants when you come to Lotus Piers. There’s no need for you to wear them every day.”

Lán WàngJī took hold of the mischievous hand of Wèi WúXiàn, reached for the pendant and put it back inside the box, then, he said, “Thank you, Leader Jiāng.”

Wèi WúXiàn then turned towards Jīn Líng, and asked, “Young Leader Jīn, have you not brought any gift for me?”

Jīn Líng did not expect his uncle to bring something, so, he said, “I am a junior. Why do you want me to give you a gift?”

Wèi WúXiàn replied, “I’ve formed a golden core. Don’t you want to congratulate me?”

“Congratulation!” said Jīn Líng without being sincere, “It must have been hard, even with your talent.”

Wèi WúXiàn said, “A-Líng, why are you like this? How about giving me a few jars of wine from LánlíngJīn?”

Jīn Líng then said, “I will give you fifty jars of wine that are more than twenty years old. However, you can drink them only when HánGuāng-Jūn allows you to drink.”

Wèi WúXiàn smiled, and said, “Young Leader Jīn, you are indeed very wealthy.”

Then, the four of them chatted for a short while. And the more friendly Wèi WúXiàn became as before towards Jiāng Chéng, the more cautious the latter became.

Then, Jiāng Chéng said that he had some matter to deal with, and, along with Jīn Líng, they took their leave.

As they stepped out of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù’s main gate, Jīn Líng said, “Uncle, it turns out that Wèi WúXiàn and you can get along so well.”

“What do you mean by that?” Jiāng Chéng asked.

“You know what I mean,” replied Jīn Líng, then he went on, “Uncle, I think it’s good for both of you to be on friendly terms.”

Jiāng Chéng said, “Children should talk less, when they don’t know how to judge a situation.”

“I’m no longer a kid,” protested Jīn Líng, then, he tried to advise him, “Uncle, from now on, both of you should always be like this.”

“Don’t talk nonsense!” said Jiāng Chéng, “This is something I can decide on my own.”

Jīn Líng didn’t have anything else to say after that.

Although both of them knew that Wèi WúXiàn had always been broad-minded, and never bore any grudge against them, still, there was an awkward feeling that still lingered.

And also, they knew that, after he married Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn became even more open-minded and very happy.
