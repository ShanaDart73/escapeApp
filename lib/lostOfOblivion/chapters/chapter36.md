“Wèi-qiánbèi, step back!” Lán JǐngYí cried out.

About five or six feet away from them, there were two walking corpses staggering to their feet, with their tattered clothes that would fall off at the slightest breeze.

As soon as they noticed the presence of Yílíng Lǎozǔ, the two copses got scared and, immediately, turned around and began to run away just slightly faster than when they were walking towards them.

Despite their ugly appearance and bad smell, those kind of walking copses didn’t pose any threat at all. Even a common person with a physical strength could knock them down.

Still, in a serious manner, Lán JǐngYí told Wèi WúXiàn to take cover behind him, then he threw two talismans towards those walking copses, and, instantly, they were mobilised.

Then, Lán SīZhuī gently plucked at the strings of his guqin and released two spiritual strings that tied them up.

Wèi WúXiàn amusingly clapped his hands and said, “My two brave heroes are really amazing. You are the models of the GūsūLán clan, young talents with outstanding grace. I feel completely at ease with you two protecting me.”

Lán JǐngYí felt embarrassed and smiled awkwardly, “Sorry, Wèi-qiánbèi. I shouldn’t have shouted at you just now.”

“It’s okay. I’m here to make you both gain some experience,” replied Wèi WúXiàn.

Lán SīZhuī earnestly said, “Wèi-qiánbèi, we all have decided to get stronger as soon as possible in order to protect you during Night Hunting.”

Then, he added, “We were really worried about you when you went missing. Then, we were very sad when you didn’t recognise us, because you had lost your memories.

“Just now, JǐngYí panicked and yelled at you out of concern.”

Wèi WúXiàn then smiled and said, “In that case, from now on, I will trouble you two to protect me, a weak man.”

Then, the three of them were lively chatting and laughing while going back to the small village they had left earlier.

Today, Wèi WúXiàn had brought several teenagers along for Night Hunting. And, upon their arrival, they met some authorities’ staff who had requested help, as well as coming across an old man, who was a firewood seller living in a remote village in the mountains.

After checking and noting that the evil spirits in the town were not hard to handle, Wèi WúXiàn decided to take Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí along to the village with the old man and leave the rest of the teenagers to deal with the town governor’s request.

And, in case an unexpected incident occurred while he was away, someone from GūsūLán villa nearby would be there in no time to assist the teenagers.

Taking Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí along was not initially Wèi WúXiàn’s plan. These youngsters didn’t want to let him act on his own, so they insisted on tagging along.

The village was built deep in the mountains with small alleys and lanes between the houses. Upon entering the village, one could smell the fragrance of flowers in the air, hear birds singing from the surrounding trees, and perceive the faint gurgling sound of a stream.

With a thin mist lingering at the top of the mountains, the small village emanated a warm and cosy ambience.

As the three of them reached the village, after getting rid of walking corpses, they heard a dog barking from a courtyard.

With his fear of dogs, Wèi WúXiàn hid himself behind Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí for fear that the dog would jump out of the courtyard and attack him.

Walking behind these two teenagers, Wèi WúXiàn felt indeed at ease and protected.

As soon as he saw them, the village chief, with a sincere smile on his face, walked towards Wèi WúXiàn and the two teenagers and thanked them.

In addition to being grateful to them, the villagers didn’t expect to receive three immortal-like cultivators from an outstanding sect in their isolated village.

For quite a long time, walking corpses had been a problem for those villagers. Luckily enough, they didn’t cause any harm, except scaring people.

Then, the three of them were warmly invited to stay for dinner and were served some delicious local dishes, namely ground pot chicken, spicy steamed beef, fried diced pork in bean sauce, potato dumplings, crispy stuffed lotus root, and fried eggs with toon leaves.

Although Lán WàngJī had been cooking for him, and, each time, making his favourite dishes, Wèi WúXiàn wasn’t a picky eater when he was away, and was satisfied eating deep fried dishes.

As for Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí, who usually ate Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù’s bland and unseasoned dishes, they were always happy when they could eat something else for a change.

Noting that the three cultivators were not arrogant, the villagers became more relaxed around them, and the village chief brought a jar of wine for them to taste.

“We will pour it ourselves,” said Wèi WúXiàn.

The two teenagers only half-filled their cups, then Lán JǐngYí, overexcited, gulped down his cup of wine, and instantly, he began to cough.

“JǐngYí, you’re really not good at tasting wine,” said Wèi WúXiàn while laughing. “You need more practice.”

Then, he drank his filled cup in one gulp. As the beverage travelled down to his stomach, Wèi WúXiàn felt a warm sensation spreading out gradually in his whole body.

“This wine is really tasty,” remarked Wèi WúXiàn.

Although he had tasted countless wines, Wèi WúXiàn was still impressed by the flavour of their wine.

“Is the taste of wine too strong?” asked the village chief. “It is brewed to be especially rich and strong. We have chosen to name it Burning Campfire.”

“What an excellent name!” Wèi WúXiàn praised. “It’s worthy of this wine.”

He filled his cup once more and gulped the wine with delight. Then, he said, “It is indeed rich and strong with a little taste of sweetness.”

With his cheeks already turned red, Lán JǐngYí was feeling dizzy, and his drunk appearance made the villagers smile.

They brought a cup of water for Lán JǐngYí to sober up. However, after drinking water, he was still drunk and collapsed on the table.

Lán SīZhuī didn’t dare to pour more wine into his cup, and Wèi WúXiàn could not help laughing at them and then decided that it would be better for himself to drink more slowly.

Noting that Wèi WúXiàn could hold his alcohol, the village chief joined him, and, together, they began to drink.

After drinking too much wine, the village chief began to talk about their farming, such as whether he should grow rice or millet, sow potatoes or radishes, and so on. Then, he moved on to talking about the number of cattle and sheep they bred in the village, as well as chickens and ducks.

Wèi WúXiàn was a talkative and easy-going type of guy. He could have a good chat with people on their family issues, as well as discussing ordinary farming work.

Lán SīZhuī was really impressed. It was the first time for him to notice how his Wèi-qiánbèi was versed in so many subjects and how easily he could discuss with the village chief any topics brought into their conversation.

Both guests and hosts had a good time during the meal, as well as during their drinking session after they had finished eating.

Noting that Wèi WúXiàn enjoyed their wine, the villagers brought several jars of Burning Campfire and told him to put them in his qiánkūn-dài* and to carry them with him.

<small>*qiánkūn-dài is a dimensionless bag that can hold more stuff than an ordinary bag.</small>

Wèi WúXiàn really liked their wine, and, since he was not a shy person, he accepted their offering with enthusiasm.

On their journey to this village, the two teenagers didn’t let Wèi WúXiàn drive Suíbiàn on his own. Lán SīZhuī had taken Wèi WúXiàn on his sword, while Lán JǐngYí flew with the old man.

Now that Lán JǐngYí was drunk and asleep, and since they had a long journey ahead, Wèi WúXiàn decided to fly on his own and asked Lán SīZhuī to carry Lán JǐngYí.

The villagers saw them off at the entrance of their village, and, suddenly, the village chief said, “We have kept calling you ‘immortal cultivator’ and have forgotten our manners. Could you please tell us your name, so, in future, everyone will remember it?”

The request startled Wèi WúXiàn a little bit, then, calmly, he replied, “My name is Wèi WúXiàn.”

“Wèi WúXiàn. It’s truly a good name,” praised the village chief. “It’s worthy of someone who knows how to appreciate wines. It’s a very suitable name for an immortal cultivator as yourself.”

Wèi WúXiàn was used to seeing people getting terrified and staying away from him once they heard his name. This was the first time in quite a while that he heard someone praising his name.

With his heart filled with joy and happiness, Wèi WúXiàn stepped on Suíbiàn, and, while flying away, he quietly looked at the small village in the mountains.

Then he thought, “Lán Zhàn, it’s great to go Night Hunting wherever evil spirits cause trouble for common people.”

Even though the compensation rumours involving GūsūLán died away, Yílíng Lǎozǔ’s notoriety would never fade away.

Wèi WúXiàn, however, didn’t give a damn about it, because, now, he had so many people who wanted to protect him.

Lán XīChén had come out of his seclusion, and his move was amazingly successful.

At first, Jīn Líng was anxious about it. Then, he tried his best and, gradually, became mature.

Although Jiāng Chéng didn’t keep in touch with him, Wèi WúXiàn was sure that he had also spent a lot of effort on the matter.

Furthermore, all the young disciples of GūsūLán really liked him. And, for his sake, they wanted to get stronger to protect him.
