            <p><b>Translator Note:</b></p>
            <p>Modaozushi (The Founder of Demonic Cultivation) is Mo Xiong Tong Xiu's masterpiece that has inspired many authors to write a side story, and, as a big fan of Modaozushi, this side story has caught my attention because Hua Guan Xiu Wei, the writer, has kept the same spirit of the original work.</p>
            <p>The original title of this story when translated in English doesn't make any sense at all, so I call it 'Lost of Oblivion' because, in this story, Wèi WúXiàn loses his happy memories spent with Lán WàngJī, yet, as oblivious as he was of his own feelings towards Lán WàngJī back when they were teenagers, this time, however, he becomes aware of it, and I find his awareness so cute that I decide to give the story this title.</p>

        <p>“Wèi qiánbèi*...” cried Yú XiǎoShān, overwhelming with remorse.</p>
        <small>*qiánbèi: a title addressed to someone older than oneself.</small>
        <p>Three hours ago, Yú XiǎoShān was assigned along with other teenagers to check the performance of the Requiem spell, which was cast on the Red Maple slope.</p>
        <p>Then, they would fly on their swords to patrol all the areas of the upper reaches of Han River.</p>
        <p>However, right now, Wèi WúXiàn spotted a pitch dark pond that they had overlooked. On close inspection, it was hard to determine the depth of the pond.</p>
        <p>At the centre, bubbles were constantly rising to the surface, like boiling water. However, when they actually touched the water, it felt icy-cold, like freezing water of a harsh winter.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled, and said, “Lán Zhàn, this promises to be interesting.”</p>
        <p>All teenagers understood that there was a need to investigate the pond. So, full of energy, the disciples of the YúnmèngJiāng sect* were already gearing up to dive in. Each of them wanted to show their swimming skills to the teenagers of the GūsūLán clan*.</p>
        <small>*‘sect’ term refers to all members of the sect, while ‘clan’ term refers to only blood-related members of the family that owns the sect.</small>
        <p>Yú XiǎoShān was the eldest grandson of the MéishānYú clan. Since he was a child, he had an outstanding spiritual power and extraordinary talent. Furthermore, he was highly praised when he was studying at Lotus Pier*.</p>
        <small>*Lotus Pier is the name of the residence of the YúnmèngJiāng sect.</small>
        <p>He was the first to put forward his proposal, he said, “Wèi qiánbèi, I am good at swimming. May I take the lead?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled, and said, “Okay. But you have to be careful. This pond is a little bit weird.”</p>
        <p>Yú XiǎoShān was young, lacking good judgement. The more he was told to be careful, the less he cared.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng*, I will dive with them because the water is too cold. However, Lán Yù and Lán Héng are not good at swimming. So, they will stay with you here, on the bank.”</p>
        <small>*Wèi Yīng: Yīng is the “first” name given from birth (same goes for Zhàn in Lán Zhàn), while WúXiàn and WàngJī are given later on.</small>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Okay.”</p>
        <p>To prevent them from freezing to death, each teenager wrapped their whole body with their spiritual power.</p>
        <p>Impatient to show off, Yú XiǎoShān went ahead and dived in.</p>
        <p>Fast and agile, Yú XiǎoShān was swimming like a fish. And, on his way down, he noticed that the water was undisturbed. He also observed some small fish swimming about, but he didn’t detect anything unusual.</p>
        <p>Yú XiǎoShān said to himself, “There is nothing special about this pond.” Then, he sped up his pace, and, soon after, he saw the bubbles streaming upwards, and decided to follow their source.</p>
        <p>At the bottom of the pond, Yú XiǎoShān found a stout and magnificent stone pillar. And, on the surface of the pillar, there was a huge spiral pattern.</p>
        <p>Following closely behind, Lán WàngJī also saw the stone pillar. He gestured at the rest of the teenagers to surround the pillar.</p>
        <p>Worried that the disciples of the GūsūLán clan would outstrip him, Yú XiǎoShān picked up speed towards the base of the stone pillar.</p>
        <p>However, upon reaching the bottom, his field of vision was blocked by a few long grey “ribbons”.</p>
        <p>Those “ribbons” were floating in front of Yú XiǎoShān, occasionally, tickling his face.</p>
        <p>Before Lán WàngJī could stop him, Yú XiǎoShān impulsively grabbed the “ribbons” and pulled them hard.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, a very big pair of eyes like two huge lanterns appeared in front of him.</p>
        <p>These enormous eyes were so bright that they illuminated the bottom of the pond, while being frightening at the same time.</p>
        <p>It turned out that the spiral pattern was in fact the body of a colossal beast. This creature had coiled itself upside down around the stone pillar. And, it was its beard that Yú XiǎoShān pulled, causing it to wake up from its sleep.</p>
        <p>And then, a very loud and furious roar stormed, sending strong vibrations, which almost damaged everyone’s eardrums.</p>
        <p>The roar of the beast caused the water of the pond to be in turmoil. And, this commotion struck fear into everyone's heart.</p>
        <p>Get out of water! Quick!</p>
        <p>Like having the devil at their heels, everyone at once began to swim upwards.</p>
        <p>One by one, Lán WàngJī led the teenagers to emerge from the water. And, for a while, there was a rush of the youngsters surfacing one after another.</p>
        <p>Once out of the water, each teenager summoned their sword, and flew to the bank.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the colossal beast kept on stirring the water, turning the centre of the pond into a huge vortex.</p>
        <p>Lán Qí, a teenager from GūsūLán clan, who had just stepped on his sword, but hadn’t the time to steady himself, was caught in the vortex.</p>
        <p>“Lán Qí!” cried out Wèi WúXiàn in terror.</p>
        <p>At that instant, a bright blue light swept in the air. Lán WàngJī was already next to Lán Qí, picked him up, and flew to the bank.</p>
        <p>Yú XiǎoShān, who had swum deeper than others, fell behind. As he surfaced and got on his sword, he felt a threatening presence behind him, and he couldn’t help but turn his head.</p>
        <p>He saw a camel-like head, two deer-like horns, a snake-like neck, eagle-like claws, and a body fully covered with carp-like scales. The best had an embedded pearl on its chin, a long grey beard, and some upward scales on its throat.</p>
        <p>He also observed a huge pair of golden eyes fiercely staring at him.</p>
        <p>It was a young dragon! A young dragon that would soon become a fully fledged dragon.</p>
        <p>The young dragon opened its dreadful mouth, and, like a tsunami, it launched itself towards Yú XiǎoShān.</p>
        <p>Yú XiǎoShān was helplessly looking at the young dragon that would soon devour him. He was so terrified that he could no longer move. His legs began to wobble, almost causing him to fall off from his sword.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, from the corner of his eye, he noticed a flash of red light. He didn’t have the time to react that, in the very next instant, he was thrust towards the bank by Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>To fly as fast as he could, Wèi WúXiàn used all his spiritual power. Now, he felt exhausted. Furthermore, since there was no more spiritual power left to feed his sword, Wèi WúXiàn could no longer make Suíbiàn* move.</p>
        <small>*Suíbiàn is the name of Wèi WúXiàn’s sword.</small>
        <p>The open mouth of the young dragon was getting closer, and, not only Wèi WúXiàn could see its sharp teeth and blood-red tongue, but also his field of vision was filled with its monstrous mouth.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn could even smell the stench of rotten meat reeking from its mouth; the smell of death.</p>
        <p>He thought to himself, “This is not the first time I am facing death.”</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng!”</p>
        <p>As soon as this well-known voice to him reached his ears, instantly, the owner of that voice occupied Wèi WúXiàn’s mind completely.</p>
        <p>His voice, which was always gentle and calm, now sounded like a white crane crying out in pain.</p>
        <p>To hear such a great distress in his voice hurt Wèi WúXiàn’s heart profoundly.</p>
        <p>Then, time seemed to stand still, and, although this vast world was populated, at that instant, the world became an empty place, except for only that person.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s heart began to beat rapidly. He then sensed a flow of spiritual power rushing through his veins.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn!” said to himself while clenching his fists tight, “Lán Zhàn is worried about me. I must not die!”</p>
        <p>He suddenly smiled.</p>
        <p>His smile was so bright that it eclipsed the sun.</p>
        <p>And, for a split second, it seemed to Lán WàngJī that he once more saw the invincible opponent in the battle of Jiānglíng, when thousands of Wēn sect’s cultivators had surrounded him However, none of them could get close to him.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was standing in the middle of the fierce* corpses, which were under his command. His untied hair was fluttering in the wind. And, the melodious sound of his flute was like played by a celestial being.</p>
        <small>*The term ‘fierce’ is used to describe a corpse with a strong resentment, hence the corpse is invincible.</small>
        <p>Back then, Wèi WúXiàn had the same smile on his face, arrogantly glancing at his opponents, looking down upon the world, everything was under his control.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn boldly said, “So what if you’ll soon turn into a fully fledged dragon. Who do you think you are to make Lán Zhàn feel so sad.”</p>
        <p>In an instant, there was a very warm sensation in his abdomen, then his whole body was filled with vigorous spiritual power.</p>
        <p>The red light of Suíbiàn became brighter, and, like a shooting star, Suíbiàn dashed towards the bank, covering several yards in the blink of an eye.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī, who had also rushed towards him, hugged Wèi WúXiàn in the air, holding him tight, he flew to the bank.</p>
        <p>The young dragon didn’t chase after them. It just hovered over the pond, quietly watching them, the mortal beings, while exhaling white fumes through its nostrils.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn stood side by side on the bank, fearlessly looking at the young dragon, and defiantly pointing their swords towards it.</p>
        <p>After a little while, it appeared as though the young dragon felt that fighting with those humans was beneath its dignity. It disdainfully wagged its tail, then flew away.</p>
        <p>As soon as the young dragon had gone, dark clouds began to appear in the sky. In the next instant, the sky was completely covered with the rolling gloomy clouds.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, lightning streaked through the clouds, soon followed by a loud sound of the thunder. And then, a heavy rain abruptly began to pour down.</p>
        <p>In no time, they were all drenched to the skin.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s wet fringe stuck on his forehead, while rainwater was sliding down his cheeks.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn.” he called, turning his head towards Lán WàngJī, and was instantly shocked to see the white parts of Lán WàngJī’s eyes had turned red. It was a terrible sight.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s heart was in pain. He then smiled, and said; “I was really scared. So, hurry up and soothe m––”</p>
        <p>He hadn’t even finished his sentence that Lán WàngJī abruptly pulled him into his arms, and covered his mouth in a deep kiss.</p>
        <p>The sandalwood fragrance of Lán WàngJī also wrapped around Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was so fervently kissed that he felt his whole body becoming feeble. Furthermore, Lán WàngJī was holding him so tight that his upper body began to hurt.</p>
        <p>Putting his hands against Lán WàngJī’s chest, Wèi WúXiàn tried his best to break free. Then, gasping for breath, he said, “Wait! We are in front of kids...”</p>
        <p>Paying no heed to Wèi WúXiàn’s attempt, Lán WàngJī put one hand on the back of Wèi WúXiàn’s head, and vigorously pulled him back into his arms, while his other hand clapped on Wèi WúXiàn’s buttocks firmly, he turned around.</p>
        <p>With his back, Lán WàngJī put Wèi WúXiàn out of sight of the teenagers, who were so shocked that their jaws dropped open.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn moaned in pain. However, this time, he didn’t dare to struggle. Instead, he submissively wrapped his arms around Lán WàngJī’s neck, and let him give vent to his distress.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī’s kisses were like a tornado, causing havoc wherever it passed. Biting Wèi WúXiàn’s lower lip as though he wanted to tear it off. Sucking his tongue to the point that Wèi WúXiàn began to feel the base of his tongue going numb.</p>
        <p>Gradually, Wèi WúXiàn was getting close to losing his consciousness. His arms began to slide down from Lán WàngJī’s neck. And, before he could pass out, Lán WàngJī finally let go of his mouth.</p>
        <p>Still holding Wèi WúXiàn tight, Lán WàngJī let him rest his head on his chest, while turning his own head, and quietly looking at the teenagers. His ears became red with embarrassment.</p>
        <p>At the moment they saw Lán WàngJī turning his head towards them, some YúnmèngJiāng sect’s disciples hurriedly turned around to avoid eye contact. Lán SīZhuī blindfolded Lán JǐngYí with his hands, while closing his own eyes tight.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn pressed his forehead against Lán WàngJī’s chin, wrapped his arms around him, and gave him a few pats on the back to comfort him.</p>
        <p>They peacefully hugged each other for a while.</p>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn slightly raised his head, and pecked Lán WàngJī on the cheek. He tenderly said, “Lán Zhàn, I formed a golden core*.”</p>
        <small>*Golden core is the source of the spiritual energy.</small>

            <p>“Lán Zhàn, this is not a normal rain.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
            <p>“Uh-huh.” agreed Lán WàngJī. He then looked far into the distance, observing the endless dark clouds that covered the whole city, the torrential rain that poured like hell, and the strong wind that roared like a tiger.</p>
            <p>Soon after, a firework signal in the shape of nine petals of the lotus flower flickered in the air. This firework signal belonged to YúnmèngJiāng sect.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Someone from YúnmèngJiāng clan will come this way. Let’s wait here for whoever will arrive, so, together, we can discuss what to do next.”</p>
            <p>The area in which they were presently was the region of Yúnmèng, a territory that was under the jurisdiction of the YúnmèngJiāng sect. Therefore, they could not handle this rain issue without their permission.</p>
            <p>After a while, a cultivator dressed in purple arrived on his sword, looking exhausted; a sign that indicated that something must have happened. His name was Jiāng Yuán, and was stationed at the local post tower.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn was inwardly surprised that there was a post tower of Lotus Piers nearby.</p>
            <p>Jiāng Yuán bowed to Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn, then said, “This rainstorm is so violent that it has caused flash floods in many places in the downstream areas of Han River.</p>
            <p>“Furthermore, water ghouls have taken advantage of the flooding to attack people.</p>
            <p>“The leader has already sent our people to every embankment’s location, so to protect them from bursting under pressure of water.</p>
            <p>“Right now, however, there is a shortage of manpower, so the leader has dispatched a request for assistance to LánlíngJīn, GūsūLán and QīnghéNiè clans.”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn inwardly said, “Jiāng Chéng* has always been arrogant and aloof. For him to swallow his pride and ask for help to other clans surely shows that the situation must be extremely serious, that lives of common people are at stake.”</p>
            <small>*Jiāng Chéng is the name of the leader of the YúnmèngJiāng sect.</small>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Where is Leader Jiāng as we speak?”</p>
            <p>Jiāng Yuán replied, “The leader is in charge of protecting the Shiyan embankment.”</p>
            <p>The embankment of Shiyan was built where the width of Han River was the most narrow, and also it was mostly likely to be damaged by the floods. Since Jiāng Chéng was personally supervising the operation there, this was another sign that the situation of the lower reaches of Han River must be critical.</p>
            <p>During all this time, eyes filled with tears, Yú XiǎoShān was inwardly blaming himself, unable to utter a single word.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn, who was briefly informed of what happened in the pond, patted him on the shoulder, and said, “In the recent years, there has been many floods occurring in Yúnmèng. Now, it’s clear that they were caused by that young dragon.</p>
            <p>“It has also altered the spiritual energy of the earth and water, causing the monsters and evil spirits to appear more frequently.</p>
            <p>“But now that the young dragon has gone, this heavy rain won’t last more than three days, and all these issues will be resolved at once. There might be a favourable weather for a decade to come.”</p>
            <p>Yú XiǎoShān was still young after all, and could no longer hold back his tears. He started to cry. Then, he felt embarrassed, and wiped away his tears. While choking back the tears, he called  “Wèi qiánbèi...”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled, then adjusted the collar of Yú XiǎoShān’s school uniform, and said, “It’s all right. Who has ever done a few reckless things when they were young. I was much more of a fool than you back then. Cheer up!”</p>
            <p>The other teenagers from YúnmèngJiāng sect gathered around Wèi WúXiàn, then, in a low voice and in a discordant manner, they called, “Wèi qiánbèi.”</p>
            <p>One by one, Wèi WúXiàn fondled the top of their heads. Then, he addressed to everyone, “Right now, we cannot any longer return to Lotus Piers by boat.</p>
            <p>“Since this place is where the young dragon cultivated itself, SīZhuī and JǐngYí, both of you will stay here along with the rest of GūsūLán disciples, in case something else happens.</p>
            <p>“As for the disciples of YúnmèngJiāng sect, who are more familiar with this area, come along with us. HánGuāng-Jūn* and I are going to Shiyan embankment to join Leader Jiāng. On our way there, we will fly over Han River in order to inspect the level of the river.”</p>
            <small>*HánGuāng-Jūn is the honorific title of Lán WàngJī.</small>
            <p>“Yes, sir!” agreed everyone.</p>
            <br />
            <p>... ... ...</p>
            <br />
            <p>Lán WàngJī had taken Wèi WúXiàn to ride on his sword.</p>
            <p>Wrapping his arms around Lán WàngJī’s waist, and while fiddling with Lán WàngJī’s waist pendant, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Second Brother*, you will be tired. Let me ride on my own sword.”</p>
            <small>*Second Brother (二哥哥, èr gēgē) is referred to the second child of a family.</small>
            <p>Lán WàngJī said, “You just formed your golden core. So, for the time being, you should not use your spiritual power.”</p>
            <p>He then held Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, and added, “When we arrive at Shiyan embankment, you’ll need to meditate in order to stabilise your golden core.”</p>
            <p>Flying through the strong storm that caused them to move much slower than usual, they all had wrapped their whole bodies with a waterproof spell.</p>
            <p>Beneath, the river was raging; they could observe a sharp increase in the level of water, and also, in many places, the river had already overflown the embankments.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, Lán WàngJī stopped Bìchén*. Pointing towards a location, he asked, “What is that?”</p>
            <small>*Bìchén is the name of Lán WàngJī’s sword.</small>
            <p>Everyone looked in the direction he had pointed his finger, and saw a huge hole on the ground that was surrounded by a woodland with an abundant vegetation.</p>
            <p>Jiāng Yuán replied, “That is Ganlin Reservoir. It was built under the reign of the previous dynasty. It is now abandoned.</p>
            <p>“In the last years of the previous dynasty, the downstream areas of Han River were occupied by the army of the current dynasty.</p>
            <p>“In order to crush the enemy, the emperor of the previous dynasty personally order to construct a dam, so that when the flood happened, the overflow of water would be stored in that reservoir, and, later on, to be released in order to inundate the downstream areas.</p>
            <p>“In the year the dam was built, there was a high flood peak. However, when the flood occurred, water failed to go towards Ganlin Reservoir. Instead, it diverted to Ankang River.</p>
            <p>“Ankang City is nearby, and the width of its river is unfortunately much narrow, and, as a result, the Ankang embankment burst under pressure, and the city was flooded.</p>
            <p>“The flood had caused a lot of casualties in the downstream areas of Ankang River, which in turn had caused common people to harbour a grievance against their own emperor.</p>
            <p>“Few years after that incident, the previous dynasty was exterminated by the current dynasty.”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Is it be possible to divert the overflow of water to that reservoir, if we blow up the dam?”</p>
            <p>Jiāng Yuán replied, “Yes, it is possible. However, at the end of the previous dynasty, people started to live near the reservoir.</p>
            <p>“As you can see, this area is fertile, and the crop yields are high. So, more and more people have come here to settle. And, up to the present time, that area turns into a village of about a hundred households.</p>
            <p>“If the dam is blown up, the village will be submerged.</p>
            <p>“In fact, people are not supposed to live in that location. Although the imperial officials came multiple times to persuade them to move out, the villagers are reluctant to leave the land they are attached to.</p>
            <p>“The leader also came to persuade them, but they still haven’t changed their mind.</p>
            <p>“In recent years, there have been some minor floods occurring in their village, but nothing serious has ever happened. So, year after year, their relocation process has been put off.”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “The young dragon that had concealed itself inside the pond has caused changes in the weather conditions. That’s why we have this unusual heavy rain.</p>
            <p>“So, this time, the disaster will happen and very soon. Those villagers must leave the village without delay.</p>
            <p>“If you have the decree of your sect with you, go and ask the imperial officials to come to the village. We’ll wait for you there.”</p>
            <p>Then, he talked to Lán WàngJī, “Lán Zhàn, let’s go to the village.”</p>
            <p>“Okay.” agreed Lán WàngJī, then he set Bìchén in motion and flew towards the village, along with the rest of YúnmèngJiāng disciples.</p>
            <br />
            <p>... ... ...</p>
            <br />
            <p>Wěishàn was the name of the village, and the negotiation began as soon as the imperial officials arrived.</p>
            <p>“HánGuāng-Jūn, even though you are highly regarded in the elite society, you should not trouble yourself with our mundane matters.</p>
            <p>“We have been living in this village for four or five generations. Are you really expecting us to move out just because you told us to do so?” said the village chief arrogantly, banging his walking stick on the floor as he uttered his last words.</p>
            <p>“No way!” objected the rest of the villagers.</p>
            <p>“We can’t just leave, and abandon our homes.” voiced a villager.</p>
            <p>The drill instructor in charge of the relocation process stepped in, “Every year, in spring, the prefect issues a relocation order for you to move out.</p>
            <p>“This year, because the warlock predicted changes in meteorological phenomena, the prefect has issued three consecutive emergency orders. And yet, you still refuse to be relocated.</p>
            <p>“You are living in a land which is lower than the level of the river. Are you not afraid?</p>
            <p>“I know that you have already packed your belongings, but you refuse to cooperate, unless someone gets tough on you. Am I right?”</p>
            <p>After a short pause, the drill instructor resumed, “The compensation has already been assessed. Right now, you are taking the advantage of this emergency to increase the amount of the compensation.”</p>
            <p>Persuading those people to move out from their village had always been a hassle. Upon seeing the decree of the YúnmèngJiāng sect, the authorities had mobilised nearly a hundred officials to assist in relocating the villagers.</p>
            <p>Lán WàngJī reiterated, “As I have already said, I promise you that GūsūLán will pay for your looses, if the authorities fail to compensate you in time.”</p>
            <p>The village chief reacted, “I don’t believe in your promise, because you people from the privileged sects are the most deceitful mankind. When the time comes, neither your sect nor the authorities will easily accept to compensate us.”</p>
            <p>Another villager put forward, “We have never experienced any disaster despite the heavy rains that pour down every year. So, we won’t leave!”</p>
            <p>Then, one after another, the villagers started to raise their voice, behaving as though the imminent threat was none of their concern.</p>
            <p>Time was running out, and, standing behind Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn could not take it any longer. He approached the drill instructor, and, in deep voice, he asked, “Mr Zhāng, is it true that the compensation has already been assessed?”</p>
            <p>The drill instructor replied, “Yes, it’s true. The village chief saw it, and sighed it. However, the nine members of the village committee have not signed it yet.”</p>
            <p>He then took out a stack of copies from his sleeve, and handed it over to Lán WàngJī. He added, “As a matter of fact, the villagers are ready to be relocated. They are just waiting for the compensation to be paid.”</p>
            <p>For a while, the drill instructor cast a look at the villagers, then he said, “Earlier, when I inspected the village, I noticed that you have already packed your belongings.”</p>
            <p>The villagers appeared to be indifferent to what the drill instructor had just said, wearing a disdainful look on their faces.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Very well.”</p>
            <p>He then pulled off Chénqíng* from his waist belt, and carelessly began to tap on the palm of his another hand with his flute.</p>
            <small>*Chénqíng is the name of Wèi WúXiàn’s flute.</small>
            <p>A rictus appeared on the corner of his mouth, he asked, “By the way, have you ever heard of Yílíng Lǎozǔ*?”</p>
            <small>*Yílíng Lǎozǔ is the honorific title of Wèi WúXiàn.</small>
            <p>The village chief suddenly turned pale, saying inwardly, “Rumour has it that Yílíng Lǎozǔ and HánGuāng-Jūn got married, and become an inseparable couple. Could it be that this handsome young man is Yílíng Lǎozǔ?”</p>
            <p>These villagers had never seen Yílíng Lǎozǔ. However, they had heard about his prowess during the Shooting Sun campaign, his hostility on Qióngqí Path and his atrocities at Nightless Sky City. They all had shuddered with horror listening to the vicious methods of Yílíng Lǎozǔ.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn slowly turned his flute so that everyone could see the scarlet tassel that was dangling from one end of Chénqíng; the scarlet tassel was one of  Yílíng Lǎozǔ’s signatures.</p>
            <p>He then smiled, and said, “I am Yílíng Lǎozǔ, also known as Wèi WúXiàn.”</p>
            <p>As soon as he finished presenting himself, Wèi WúXiàn brought Chénqíng to his lower lip, and, at leisure, he blew a few notes.</p>
            <p>All of a sudden, they started to hear some terrifying roars coming from outside. It seemed like the assembly hall was surrounded by fierce corpses.</p>
            <p>As one would expect, the villagers got really frightened that they were no longer able to make noises.</p>
            <p>Still, it was hard to believe that the vicious Yílíng Lǎozǔ was this fair-skinned and elegant young man.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
            <p>So as to convince whoever might doubt that he was Yílíng Lǎozǔ, Wèi WúXiàn walked to the front of the hall, and slowly sat down on one of the main chairs.</p>
            <p>He then snapped his fingers, and, the very next instant, the villagers gasped in horror; a long-haired and faceless female demon in red appeared next to Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
            <p>Using his flute, Wèi WúXiàn began to stir up the demon’s hair, which had an effect of stimulating the demon’s hostility. The sight of the faceless demon became extremely frightening.</p>
            <p>Casting a sideways glance at the villagers, and in a gentle tone, yet, a tone full of threats, Wèi WúXiàn said, “I’ve run out of patience. You have until before the nightfall to leave the village. Whoever stays beyond that limit will be turned into a fierce corpse.”</p>
            <p>The terrifying Yílíng Lǎozǔ, who showed no sympathy to anyone, who just by mentioning his name made children stop crying at night, instantly made those reluctant villagers get going.</p>
            <p>There were nearly a hundred officers sent in order to assist in relocation of the villagers, and those officers brought along many horses and carts. Moreover, there were enough young adults in the village to give a hand. So, the evacuation would not be a major problem.</p>
            <p>“Mr Zhāng, now it’s down to you and your men to deal with the relocation.” said Wèi WúXiàn, “HánGuāng-Jūn and I are going to blow up the dam.”</p>
            <p>The drill instructor repeatedly said ‘yes’, while being on his guard. Apparently, the villagers were not the only ones being scared by Yílíng Lǎozǔ.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn was used to that kind of reaction. He humbly smiled to himself. What he wanted to do right now was to leave as soon as possible along with Lán WàngJī.</p>
            <p>However, at that precise moment, someone among the last few of the villagers to leave the hall suddenly stepped forward, and rudely said, “Wèi WúXiàn, you evil heretic! You’re still as insolent as ever!”</p>
            <p>That person turned out to be Fāng MèngChén*. Furthermore, this village was not only his grandmother’s homeland, but also the place where he had been living in seclusion.</p>
            <small>*Fāng MèngChén lost his parents during the Nightless Sky City bloodbath. When he got the chance to avenge their deaths, a turn of events happened, and he was instead saved by Wèi WúXiàn.</small>
            <p>“HánGuāng-Jūn, Wèi WúXiàn’s evil nature has not changed. And yet, you condone his villainy.” carried on Fāng MèngChén in a resentful way.</p>
            <p>Once there is a feeling of hatred in someone’s heart, lies and slanders are bound to be spread around, and people love to listen to the incredible and sensational rumours. Why should one bother about it? The truth never gets people excited, so it is easily ignored.</p>
            <p>The drill instructor did not at all intervene. Relocating a village, no matter how much the compensation was provided, always caused villagers to hold grudges against the authorities.</p>
            <p>Over the past ten years, three local prefects had taken office one after another. However, none of them had ever dared to tackle this relocation issue.</p>
            <p>Every time something happened that required to relocate them, if the villagers insisted on staying, the authorities had no other alternative but to give up.</p>
            <p>Now that Yílíng Lǎozǔ took on this burdensome task, the authorities had surely taken this advantage to get rid of this relocation process. However, the drill instructor didn’t go into that detail when he explained the matter to Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
            <p>Outside, the torrential rain kept on pouring. And, right now, it was a race against time to get all the villagers out of the village before the nightfall.</p>
            <p>The early yelling of the villagers had caused Wèi WúXiàn’s head to spin. He knew that there were people who had their own mindset, and trying to reason with them would be just a waste of time. Therefore, he didn’t feel like justifying himself.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn made a gesture to stop Lán WàngJī who was about to intervene, and simply said, “You knew straight away what kind of villain I am. So, why are you still here?”</p>
            <p>He then unsheathed Suíbiàn, pointed the sword towards Fāng MèngChén, and asked, “Can you beat me?” Fāng MèngChén immediately froze in fear. Then, he added, “ If you can’t, then shut up, and go help others to move out.”</p>
            <p>Fāng MèngChén’s face was filled with indignation. He then pointed his finger at Wèi WúXiàn, “You..., you...”</p>
            <p>The faceless demon turned its head, and “looked” at Fāng MèngChén, as though she was threatening him.</p>
            <p>As a result, Fāng MèngChén was no longer able to utter whatever the verbal abuse he was about to. He lifted his robes, walked towards the exit, and slammed the door as he left the hall.</p>
            <p>Still holding Chénqíng in his hand, Wèi WúXiàn waved at the female demon, and the latter disappeared. He hen thundered at the rest of villagers, “Why are you still here! Come on, get moving!”</p>
            <p>The villagers immediately dispersed, returning to their homes to get ready to leave the village.</p>
            <p>Then, the drill instructor saluted Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn with his hands brought in of him, making one into a fist while the other covered the fist. He then left the assembly hall with his men.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn sent Jiāng Yuán along with the rest of the YúnmèngJiāng disciples to assist the villagers with their relocation.</p>
            <p>Right now, the only people remained inside the hall were Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
            <p>“Wèi Yīng...” Lán WàngJī held Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, feeling extremely frustrated for not being able to defend him. He wanted to say something, but he felt that his words would not convey his feelings. Besides, he knew that he was not good at expressing himself.</p>
            <p>Seeing that his sweetheart was longing to say something but unable to utter a single word, Wèi WúXiàn put an end to his struggle by placing Chénqíng over Lán WàngJī’s lips.</p>
            <p>He then said, while smiling, “HánGuāng-Jūn, you’re such an angel. You always stand by my side. Cheer up! Don’t be so sad. I don’t care what other people think of me. I only care about you, and how you see me.”</p>
            <p>He wrapped his arms around Lán WàngJī’s waist. His gaze became flirtatious, and his voice coquettish, “So, keep on pampering me, and never leave me.”</p>
            <p>He then stood on tiptoe, leaned close to Lán WàngJī’s white jade colour-like ear, softly blew into the ear, and said, “You are mine.”</p>
            <p>As soon as he heard those words, Lán WàngJī held Wèi WúXiàn tight into his arms, and earnestly said, “You are mine, too.”</p>
            <p>What is right and what is wrong are judged by oneself. One’s reputation is judged by others. One’s gains and losses are at the mercy of their quantity.</p>
            <p>For Lán WàngJī, his Wèi Yīng was still the same, despite many hardships he had gone through.</p>
            <br />
            <p>... ... ...</p>
            <br />
            <p>Located ten miles away from Wěishàn Village, the dam stood tall and majestic, on the top, five carts could drive abreast, and its outer walls were coated with iron, making the dam very resistant and solid.</p>
            <p>Spiritual powers were primarily used to slay evil spirits, demons and monsters. Since all things in this world had their own laws and principles, cultivators’ powers turned out to be very limited in dealing with the mundane things.</p>
            <p>So, destroying this robust dam in a very short period of time, even for someone with high spiritual power like Lán WàngJī, would take a lot of efforts to succeed.</p>
            <p>In the pouring rain, Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn carefully selected the appropriate positions for the detonation. Then, they wrapped each blasting talisman with a waterproof spell, and then, placed them on the selected positions.</p>
            <p>The blasting talismans were emitting a clear blue light through the rain. However, from a distance, the emitted blue light grew dimmer.</p>
            <p>Those talismans, however, would be activated only after all villagers had reached the main road, which was located near the mountains. Then, Lán WàngJī would use his spiritual power to strike on the holes that would be made with the blasting talismans.</p>
            <p>The night would fall in less than two hours. Meanwhile, Lán WàngJī gave Wèi WúXiàn some assorted rice balls, and regretfully said, “I didn’t bring enough food to eat, because I didn’t expect this turn of events.”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn leaned his head on Lán WàngJī’s shoulder. Licking his fingers after he had eaten a rice ball, he said, “Second Brother, it was delicious. What did you put inside? Was it a plum? It was soft with a little bit of the sour taste. You’re so wonderful.”</p>
            <p>Lán WàngJī’s lips curved into a smile. He wrapped one arm around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist, and put the palm of his other hand on Wèi WúXiàn’s abdomen, where the lower Dantian was located. He could feel the undulation of the spiritual power, which was much different than before.</p>
            <p>He said, “Wèi Yīng, you formed your golden core just few hours ago, so, you should get some rest. ”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “I’ll sleep for a while, then. Wake me up when Jiāng Yuán sends us a message.”</p>
            <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Okay.” Then, sitting on a rock, he extended the layer of his waterproof spell, and then, he carried Wèi WúXiàn on his lap, letting him rest on his arms.</p>
            <p>The heavy rain was pouring like a towering waterfall, under the dark and gloomy clouds, the blue sky was high and out of sight. However, they cared less about this dreadful weather, since they had each other, and nothing else mattered to them.</p>
            <p>With the exception of the rainstorm and river sounds, everything was completely silent. It seemed as though they were the only ones left in this vast world.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn formed his golden core at a critical moment. Then, for half a day, he had been rushing around, which made his golden core’s vessel become unstable. Right now, he felt extremely tired, he closed his eyes, and, in a low voice, he said, “Lán Zhàn, sing a song to lull me to sleep.”</p>
            <p>Lán WàngJī tenderly kissed Wèi WúXiàn on the forehead, then he softly began to hum WàngXiàn, a song that he composed for both of them. Soon after, Wèi WúXiàn fell into a deep sleep.</p>
            <br />
            <p>... ... ...</p>
            <br />
            <p>“Wèi Yīng... Wèi Yīng... wake up.”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn woke up from his sleep as he heard Lán WàngJī’s voice calling him. He somehow felt that he didn’t rest long enough. As was his habit, each time Lán WàngJī woke him up, Wèi WúXiàn would hug him and peck him on the cheek four or five times.</p>
            <p>With his fingers, Lán WàngJī gently combed Wèi WúXiàn’s long hair, then, he adjusted his ponytail, and said, “Jiāng Yuán sent the message saying that they all have reached the main road.”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Let’s begin, then.”</p>
            <p>In the torrential rain, Lán WàngJī summoned WàngJī*, while Wèi WúXiàn invoked spirits. Then, together, they activated all the blasting talismans.</p>
            <small>*The guqin of Lán WàngJī is named after his owner: WàngJī.</small>
            <p>The sound of the detonation roared loudly, several large holes could be seen at the bottom of the dam. However, the dam was too solid, the blasting talismans couldn’t blow through its walls.</p>
            <p>Using his guqin, Lán WàngJī began to strike with all his strength, sending WàngJī’s ice-blue spiritual notes at the bottom of the dam, and, little by little, expanding and deepening the holes that were previously made with the blasting talismans.</p>
            <p>As Lán WàngJī continued to consume his spiritual power, Wèi WúXiàn felt uneasy watching him exhausting himself.</p>
            <p>He said, “Lán Zhàn, this won’t do. I will go to Ankang River and find where the width of the river is the most narrow, then build a barrier with fierce corpses.</p>
            <p>“When the current won’t any longer carry on downstream, it will flow back and diverge here. You will then gather the force of that current to destroy the dam. ”</p>
            <p>Lán WàngJī immediately said, “No! You are not going anywhere, because your golden core is still fragile.” He then realised that the tone of his voice was a little bit harsh, and, inwardly, he regretted it.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn reassured him, “Don’t worry, I won’t use too much of my spiritual power. I will mostly use my demonic power.”</p>
            <p>He then took out from his sleeve two signal-transfer talismans. He stuck one on Lán WàngJī’s chest, and stuck the other within his clothes, at his chest level.</p>
            <p>He said, “If you succeed in blowing up the dam, use this signal-transfer talisman to let me know. Once, I receive the signal, I’ll come back here straight away.”</p>
            <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you must be careful, don’t do anything reckless. If you start to feel poorly, notify me immediately.”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn summoned Suíbiàn, then stepped on it. He leaned forward and kissed Lán WàngJī, he then said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, I’m afraid that we won’t have time to make love tonight. Since that will be the case, remember to make it up to me next time.”</p>
    </div>

    <div>
            <p>First of all, Wèi WúXiàn flew back to Wěishàn Village, and observed that it was completely empty, not even a single farm animal was left behind.</p>
            <p>Like the drill instructor mentioned earlier that the villagers had already packed their belongings, which, fortunately, made the evacuation to be done much faster.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn then proceeded on what brought him here by blowing on Chénqíng so as to summon a large numbers of fierce corpses from the graveyard of the village.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, he began to hear some cries, which were undoubtedly made by a baby.</p>
            <p>Guided by the cries, Wèi WúXiàn found a baby girl, around three months old, inside of one of the empty houses.</p>
            <p>Favouring boys over girls was the only reason that came into Wèi WúXiàn’s mind to explain why the parents of this baby heartlessly abandon their own daughter.</p>
            <p>On a table, Wèi WúXiàn noticed a jar of milk, and, by the smell, he determined that it was from a sheep. Leaving this milk was probably the parents’ wish to ease the soul of the baby after death.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn found it rather ironic to care for the soul of the baby rather than the baby herself, letting out a heavy sigh of despair.</p>
            <p>He then took a sip of sheep milk in order to ensure its freshness, and quickly warmed it up with his spiritual power. Using a wooden spoon, also found on the table, he began to feed the baby.</p>
            <p>However, not only the little baby girl was not familiar with Wèi WúXiàn’s scent, but also she was neither accustomed to the taste of sheep milk, nor was she used to be fed with a spoon. All of this caused her to cry even louder, wanting to be held and breastfed by her mother.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn tried to soothe the crying baby, first by swinging side to side while holding her, then by gently stroking her back, and then by humming some nursery rhymes. However, none of these methods worked.</p>
            <p>In the end, the baby got really hungry that she finally let Wèi WúXiàn feed her.</p>
            <p>When he was a teenager, Wèi WúXiàn had taken care of his juniors of around six years old. However, he had never looked after a baby before.</p>
            <p>So, for fear that he would choke the little baby, Wèi WúXiàn took extra care to fed her. And, after he finished spoon-feeding her, the baby, tired from crying so much, fell deeply asleep.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn then became concerned with the amount of time that took him to deal with the baby.</p>
            <p>Without further delay, he took the baby’s blanket and wrapped the little baby, then, holding the baby, he secured the blanket firmly around his torso like a baby wrap carrier, and was ready to go. </p>
            <p>Before leaving the house, Wèi WúXiàn put back the waterproof spell that he had removed when he entered into the house, then he flew towards Ankang River, giving orders to the fierce corpses to follow along.</p>
            <p>Remembering what Jiāng Yuán said about the Ankang embankment, which was burst by the flood under the reign of the previous dynasty, Wèi WúXiàn intended to build the barrier of fierce corpses at that precise location.</p>
            <p>If his assumption was correct, the embankment must have been built where the width of the river was the most narrow, which was what he wanted.</p>
            <p>The night had fallen in this dreadful rain, so, Wèi WúXiàn took out few fire-talismans from his sleeve, and ignited them so as to light his way to Ankang River.</p>
            <p>Also illuminated by the talismans, Han River beneath was still turbulent, and the level of the water kept on increasing.</p>
            <p>Upon reaching Ankang River, Wèi WúXiàn easily spotted the location of his interest, since the embankment had never been repaired, and, furthermore, at that spot, the current ran much faster.</p>
            <p>He pulled off Chénqíng, brought it to his lips, but, all the sudden, he paused, appeared to have forgotten something.</p>
            <p>He put his flute back on his waist belt, unshielded Suíbiàn, and cut two small and clean pieces of his gown, then, carefully, he plugged the baby’s ears with the two pieces of cloth.</p>
            <p>The little baby was still sleeping soundly, putting her tiny little hands on Wèi WúXiàn’s chest.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn noticed it, and the whole scene brought a warm smile on his face.</p>
            <p>He then prodded her gently on the cheek, and said, “Young girl, wait that I finish my work here, then I will take you to see my HánGuāng-Jūn. He is the most handsome man in the world. You’re definitely going to like him.”</p>
            <p>Then, he pulled off Chénqíng, and began to blow some notes. In response to the sound of the flute, the fierce corpses from Wěishàn Village’s graveyard jumped into the river.</p>
            <p>From the riverbed and across the river, a tall wall of fierce corpses was formed, then, countless of water ghouls emerged from water, and scrambled up to fill the gaps between fierce corpses.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn intensified the sound of his flute, which cut through the darkness of the night, spread across the surroundings, and resounded through the sky.</p>
            <p>Soon after, more water ghouls came over, and quickly placed themselves on the remnants of the embankment so as to rebuild a new one.</p>
            <p>Ever since Wèi WúXiàn had returned from death, this was the first time he used his demonic power on such a large scale.</p>
            <p>In this heavy rain, the barrier of fierce corpses and water ghouls was completed, and the Ankang embankment was temporarily repaired with water ghouls. </p>
            <p>The downstream flow of water progressively dropped, while, on the other side of the barrier, the coming waves hit violently the newly erected barrier.</p>
            <p>At this rate, the barrier would not withstand the pressure much longer, so, Wèi WúXiàn summoned more corpses from far to reinforce the barrier.</p>
            <p>However, it was not an easy task to overcome the force of nature, even for Yílíng Lǎozǔ, the founder of demonic cultivation.</p>
            <p>At that instance, he felt a violent swing in his golden core vessel, immediately followed by a sharp pain as though his abdomen was ripped open.</p>
            <p>“Oh gosh!” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, “I haven’t had the time to reconcile my newly formed golden core with my demonic power. Right now, the two opposite powers are clashing with each other.”</p>
            <p>Ever since he had been living with Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn had rarely used his demonic power.</p>
            <p>However, right now, not only he overused it, but also the existence of the freshly formed golden core made the situation to be more alarming. So, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t dare to be reckless. Besides, he had promised Lán WàngJī that he would be careful.</p>
            <p>The last thing to be done was to use talismans to stabilise the barrier that he had just finished building, then, with the baby girl, he would rejoin Lán WàngJī.</p>
            <p>However, all the remains of talismans in his possession were all marked with ‘blasting’ character on them; no more blank talismans left to be used for the barrier.</p>
            <p>This inconvenience, however, didn’t stop him from carrying out his last task. He stepped on Suíbiàn, then got close to the barrier, and, up there, he cut his fingers with his sword, and then, using his blood, Wèi WúXiàn began to draw a series of characters on the barrier.</p>
            <p>After he had finished marking the whole barrier, a bright red light shone from it like a wildfire blazing across the woods.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, however, the pain in his golden core vessel had progressively increased. Now, it became unbearable.</p>
            <p>“It’s done.” said to himself. Then, all of a sudden, he got dizzy, and, with the extreme pain in his abdomen, he was no longer able to stand on his sword, and fell on his butt along with his sword on the riverbed presently exhibited.</p>
            <p>Using Suíbiàn as a support, and not allowing the silt to dirty the baby’s blanket, Wèi WúXiàn managed to stand up.</p>
            <p>Then, he said, “This dizziness is caused by my using too much blood. I’m afraid that this time I have to drink the GūsūLán bitter decoction without complaint.”</p>
            <p>At that precise moment, he felt a murderous aura, and, since he had been on the battlefields, facing death countless times, instinctively, Wèi WúXiàn dodged while protecting the baby.</p>
            <p>The very next instant of him avoiding the unknown danger, a flash of energy of a sword whizzed past him.</p>
            <p>A corner of his sleeve was torn off by the energy of that sword. Furthermore, the ripped cloth was sliced into small pieces, flew a few yards away, and landed scattered on the mud of the riverbed.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn then turned his head towards where the attack came from, and, to his astonishment, he saw Fāng MèngChén.</p>
            <p>Fāng MèngChén had left Wěishàn Village along with the rest of the villagers. However, soon after they had reached the main road, a quarrel broke out between the villagers and the youngsters of the YúnmèngJiāng sect.</p>
            <p>Soon, the scene became chaotic, and, taking advantage of the conflict, Fāng MèngChén sneaked away with his sword, and flew back to the village. Just as he approached the village, he saw Wèi WúXiàn, who carried a baby, flew towards Ankang City, followed by fierce corpses.</p>
            <p>“So, it’s you, who furtively attacked me.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
            <p>“Yes, it’s me. Are you surprised to see me?” uttered Fāng MèngChén with a face full of hatred. “I’m here to put an end to your despicable existence.” he added.</p>
            <p>After secretly following Wèi WúXiàn, Fāng MèngChén had hidden himself inside the dense woods on one side of the river, waiting for Wèi WúXiàn to exhaust himself, as well as using up all his spiritual power.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately for Wèi WúXiàn, there were no more corpses or water ghouls in a radius of several miles that he could summon to fight against Fāng MèngChén.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, he could not afford to break the spell of the talismans, and use the fierce corpses that were holding the water of the river back, or use the ghouls that formed the embankment as a flood prevention.</p>
            <p>So, bearing the severe pain in his abdomen, Wèi WúXiàn held Suíbiàn on one hand, and shielded the baby with the other hand, he fought and exchanged several attacks with Fāng MèngChén.</p>
            <p>For some time, they attacked each other with their spiritual powers without interruption.</p>
            <p>Then, as it was advisable for him not to use too much of his spiritual power, came an acute sensation from his abdomen. At that instance, Wèi WúXiàn sensed that some cracks were formed in his golden core, similar to those in a crystal ball.</p>
            <p>Trying hard to stand firm on his feet while concealing any flaws, Wèi WúXiàn said, “You are here to avenge the death of your parents, however, your revenge has nothing to do with this baby. So, let me put her on the riverbank.” </p>
            <p>Fāng MèngChén snorted, and said sharply, “Why should I spare the life of your evil child?”</p>
            <p>Irritated, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Are you mad? This baby is not my child.”</p>
            <p>Being as stubborn as a mule, Fāng MèngChén uttered, “If the child is not yours, then why are you protecting her?” As he spoke, Fāng MèngChén gathered a great amount of energy that he transferred to his sword, and struck hard.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn didn’t dare to block the attack. He thrust Suíbiàn into the riverbed, and, with his martial art skills and the support of his sword, he shielded the baby, leaned his body backwards, and avoided the blow.</p>
            <p>Looking like a madman, Fāng MèngChén laughed hideously, and said, “Wèi WúXiàn, are you not always going on the rampage? Why do you keep on dodging my attacks, instead of being violent?”</p>
            <p>As they carried on fighting, on the other side of the barrier of fierce corpses and water ghouls, the sound of the waves were getting louder; the intense waves kept on crashing against the barrier, and shaking the ground beneath them.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, as the time passed by, the red light on the barrier was getting dimmed, as the energy of the talismans progressively weakened.</p>
            <p>Anxious, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Wait for a moment that I fix the barrier.”</p>
            <p>Fāng MèngChén sneered, “There is no use trying to buy time, since today you won’t escape death. So, if the barrier is about to collapse, then let it collapse.”</p>
            <p>Greatly upset, Wèi WúXiàn thundered, “There are common people living downstream!”</p>
            <p>Fāng MèngChén shouted back, “It’s none of my concern!”</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>As a matter of fact, Fāng MèngChén’s spiritual power was not great, nor was his swordsmanship, however, his moves were quick.</p>
        <p>He knew that Wèi WúXiàn was running out of spiritual power, and noted that Wèi WúXiàn was not in a hurry to put an end to this fight, he only spent as less as possible his physical strength.</p>
        <p>Fāng MèngChén also observed that Wèi WúXiàn was doing his best to protect the baby, so, he began to direct his attacks towards Wèi WúXiàn’s chest, aiming at the little baby.</p>
        <p>Sadly, Wèi WúXiàn began to feel dizzy again, and, moreover, it was getting harder for him to handle his sword. Also, the more he used his spiritual power the more the agonising pain in his abdomen increased.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, he could not get close to and attack Fāng MèngChén, because he feared that he would put the little baby in danger of being harmed by Fāng MèngChén.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn knew that he could not hold on forever, so, he decided to take a risk. He moved one step backwards and his foot sank into the mud of the riverbed, and, deceitfully, revealing a flaw.</p>
        <p>As Fāng MèngChén charged once more, Wèi WúXiàn shielded the baby with the energy of his sword.</p>
        <p>However, Fāng MèngChén really took the bait, and, instead of aiming at Wèi WúXiàn’s chest as he formerly intended to do so, he directed his attack towards Wèi WúXiàn’s sunk foot and stabbed his shin.</p>
        <p>This new pain in his leg helped Wèi WúXiàn to clear his head of the dizziness that he was experiencing, and, without losing any moment, Wèi WúXiàn cut off Fāng MèngChén’s arm which was brought within his reach, using his spiritual power that he transferred into Suíbiàn.</p>
        <p>A stream of blood rushed in the air, and, in severe pain, Fāng MèngChén passed out instantly.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then said, “The trick to cutting off arms, I must confess that I learned it from Lán Zhàn.”</p>
        <p>Then, there was a little sound, like the noise of an extinguished fire, coming from Suíbiàn; it had exhausted all its energy.</p>
        <p>The next instance, Wèi WúXiàn sensed the cracks in his golden core widened, then, once more, his head began to spin, and, once again, he fell on his butt on the riverbed.</p>
        <p>At the moment he ended up sitting on the mud, the signal-transfer talisman that he had placed on his chest lit up. The ice-blue light of the talisman began to throb like a heartbeat.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn succeeds!” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, overjoyed.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the sound of the raging waves became more louder, the red light of the talismans went off, and the barrier weakened; it would not resist the pressure much longer.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the fierce corpses and water ghouls at the most top of the barrier began to fall off, resulting in a small stream of water pouring over.</p>
        <p>The stream progressively expanded as corpses and ghouls continued to fall off the barrier, and soon the small stream changed into a waterfall.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was no longer able to stand up as his strength failed him.</p>
        <p>Enduring the pain in his abdomen, he quickly untied the blanket, stuck the signal-transfer talisman on the baby girl, fastened the blanket around Suíbiàn, then he sent Suíbiàn to stick on the trunk of a big tree near the riverbank.</p>
        <p>The small amount of spiritual power that Wèi WúXiàn had transferred into Suíbiàn was enough to cause more pain in his golden core vessel. He could even sense that his golden core was on the verge of shattering.</p>
        <p>Soon after Suíbiàn flew away with the baby, the barrier collapsed completely, and water rushed like a tsunami, the violent waves carried Wèi WúXiàn and Fāng MèngChén on their chaotic course downstream.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, I won’t die.” swore Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>In this turmoil of the river, Wèi WúXiàn managed to use his last bit of spiritual power to protect the vital parts of his body, namely, the head, the neck, the chest and the abdomen, then, he lost his consciousness, engulfed into the darkness.</p>
        <p>The excessive use of his spiritual power had put a lot of strain on his newly formed and still fragile golden core. Like a crystal ball, it eventually broke into small pieces, which scattered and vanished within the golden core vessel.</p>
        <br />
        <p>--- --- ---</p>
        <br />
        <p>“My Lord, although Wèi WúXiàn is infamous, in fact, it is him who forms the bond between GūsūLán and LánlíngJīn sects, as well as the bond between GūsūLán and YúnmèngJiāng sects.</p>
        <p>“GūsūLán has no longer the desire to dwell on the past events related to Wèi WúXiàn. Jīn Líng, the young leader of LánlíngJīn, holds no longer any grudge against Wèi WúXiàn. Even Leader Jiāng, the uncle of the young leader, has changed his attitude towards Wèi WúXiàn; this is due to the attachment between the young leader and Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“In the past, Zéwú-Jūn, the leader of GūsūLán, Jīn GuāngYáo, the former leader of LánlíngJīn, and Chìfēng-zūn, my Lord’s big brother and our former leader, were sworn brothers. Back then, the three of them had formed a strong alliance.</p>
        <p>“Even after our former leader had passed away, Zéwú-Jūn and Jīn GuāngYáo were still treating QīnghéNiè sect very kindly, and giving us their support every time it was needed.</p>
        <p>“At the present time, however, QīnghéNiè has no bond with any other sects, at all.”</p>
        <p>Holding a fan in his hand, Niè HuáiSāng was slowly fanning himself, while quietly listening to his underling.</p>
        <p>The morning sun had not risen yet, and the night sky was not bright, putting a shadow on Niè HuáiSāng’s face, hence making it hard for the underling to see his lord’s expression.</p>
        <p>Two days ago, the news of Wèi WúXiàn, who went missing, came as a great shock among sects.</p>
        <p>Persistently, Lán WàngJī had since played his guqin, invoking and asking spirits the whereabouts of Wèi WúXiàn, until the strings of WàngJī broke off, cutting his fingers in the process. And the guqin was smeared with blood as a result of heavy bleeding.</p>
        <p>In the end, Lán WàngJī had located Wèi WúXiàn’s presence in the vicinity of Baihe, the suburb of Ankang City.</p>
        <p>So, cultivators from the four sects, who had come to assist in flash floods, took turn in searching and throwing nets in the river, day and night.</p>
        <p>Strangely enough, it was QīnghéNiè sect which found Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Unconscious, Wèi WúXiàn was lying on the riverbank of a tributary of the Ankang River.</p>
        <p>The underling resumed, “If Wèi WúXiàn happens to disappear without a trace, HánGuāng-Jūn will be deeply devastated.</p>
        <p>“Zéwú-Jūn has been living in seclusion for many years, so, right now, GūsūLán only relies on HánGuāng-Jūn. However, if HánGuāng-Jūn is lost without Wèi WúXiàn,  GūsūLán will be in an enfeebled state.</p>
        <p>“At the same time, with Wèi WúXiàn being no longer in this world, the connections GūsūLán has with LánlíngJīn and YúnmèngJiāng will be severed.”</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng remained silent, standing close to Wèi WúXiàn, who was still lying on the riverbank, looking ghastly with dark circles under his closed eyes, his lips had turned blue, and, moreover, he was soaking wet.</p>
        <p>Several years had passed since his return from death by the means of being invoked; the summoner offered his body in exchange of having his longing revenge to be done.</p>
        <p>Progressively, the appearance of Mò XuánYǔ, the summoner, had faded away, replaced by Wèi WúXiàn’s own face.</p>
        <p>Back when they were teenagers, and attending the school at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù*, Wèi WúXiàn once said, “The spiritual power is the energy, and the resentment** is also the energy. </p>
        <small>*Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù is the name the residence of the GūsūLán sect.</small>
        <br />
        <small>**Wèi WúXiàn refers to the resentment of a dead who died/got killed in cruelly way.</small>
        <p>“The spiritual power is stored in the golden core vessel, and can be used to split mountains, or be used in various ways for a good cause. So, why the resentment, also being the energy, is forbidden to be used in doing the same things as the spiritual power?”</p>
        <p>The argument that Wèi WúXiàn had put forward shocked everyone present in the classroom, and made Lán Lǎo, the teacher, extremely furious.</p>
        <p>Later on, after school, he said, “I don’t plan on leaving the path to a bright future, and walk on the wrong side of the road. It’s much easier to follow the path that someone else had taken.</p>
        <p>“So, don’t worry about what I have said earlier. I was just answering the questions that Lán Lǎo was asking me.”</p>
        <p>However, few years later, what he had said that it would not happen did happen; Wèi WúXiàn really walked on the wrong side of the road, found himself isolated and doomed.</p>
        <p>Back in that day, when he had been informed that the teacher punished him in copying the GūsūLán rules, Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “I’m not a member of the GūsūLán sect, or planning on becoming one. Why do I have to copy their rules. I won’t do it!”</p>
        <p>However, after his return, he had join the GūsūLán sect, and, with Lán WàngJī, they became a couple who lived in perfect harmony. And, furthermore, he seemed not to mind copying the GūsūLán rules.</p>
        <p>Inside the Guānyīn temple, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Leader Niè, do you know what was inside of this now-empty coffin?”</p>
        <p>“Indeed, time has passed and things have changed. At that time, he called me ‘Leader Niè’ instead of ‘HuáiSāng-xiōng’*.” said Niè HuáiSāng inwardly.</p>
        <small>*xiōng means literally brother. The suffix is informal and more friendly. So, Niè HuáiSāng complains that Wèi WúXiàn addresses him in formal way.</small>
        <p>Should they save Wèi WúXiàn, or should they not? The underling appeared to be nervous. It was impossible for him to guess what their leader was thinking, because whether he was happy or angry, Niè HuáiSāng would not let it show.</p>
        <p>After a while, Niè HuáiSāng said, “Give me the fireworks.”</p>
        <p>Concealing his disappointment, the underling respectfully handed four fireworks to their leader. The three of the fireworks belonged to GūsūLán, LánlíngJīn and YúnmèngJiāng sects, while the fourth was their own firework.</p>
        <p>For a while, Niè HuáiSāng fiddled with the fireworks that the underling began to think that their leader had changed his mind.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, Niè HuáiSāng pulled on the four strings of the four fireworks at the same time, and, the very next instance, the four emblems that represented the four sects were flickering in the night sky.</p>
        <p>Letting off the four fireworks was the agreed signal to let other sects know that Wèi WúXiàn was found, as well as giving the exact location he was found.</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng looked up into the sky, and, while gazing at the gorgeous fireworks, he nonchalantly said, “Spread the words of the Wěishàn villagers: ‘Yílíng Lǎozǔ forced us to leave our village, then flooded our homes, and destroyed the graveyard of our ancestors.</p>
        <p>‘He also caused a hundred of us to be separated from our families. The elderly and children were in tears.</p>
        <p>‘HánGuāng-Jūn is bewitched by Yílíng Lǎozǔ, indulging himself in crime, taking advantage of the high status of his sect to bully us. He arrogantly promised to compensate us for all our losses.</p>
        <p>‘And, finally, Yílíng Lǎozǔ experimented a new devilish technique at the remnant of the Ankang embankment that went wrong, and he ended up being washed away by the flood.’ ”</p>
        <p>By the time Niè HuáiSāng finished making up the story, the underling’s whole face lit up with excitement, “My Lord’s words are very thoughtful.”</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng rectified, “It’s not me who said these words. It’s what all the villagers from Wěishàn Village said. ”</p>
        <p>All the rest of underlings understood the cunning plan of their mission.</p>
        <p>Inwardly, Niè HuáiSāng said, “My dear Wèi-xiōng, I don’t have any intention of harming you. It’s just that the power between sects needs to be balanced.</p>
        <p>“However, you are so talented, by yourself you held a turbulent river back for quite a while; it is inconceivable.</p>
        <p>“GūsūLán should not carry on being complacent because they have you, who, alone, can withstand legions of troops.”</p>
        <p>All of a sudden, an ice-blue light flashed close by.</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng asked, “What was that?”</p>
        <p>The underling replied, “My Lord, it was the light produced by a teleportation.”</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng sighed, then said to himself, “HánGuāng-Jūn blew up an extremely stout dam by himself, then, for two days, he hasn’t rested but kept on playing his guqin in order to find Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Despite all this, he still has enough spiritual power to use a teleportation! It’s so lovely to see how deep his love goes.”</p>
        <p>A smiling expression appeared on Niè HuáiSāng’s face. He took off his outer robe, and used it to cover Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Indeed, it was Lán WàngJī who arrived via a teleportation. His hands were shaking, his eyes were red, and his face was deadly pale. In fact, it was his whole appearance that was extremely dreadful.</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng gently said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, don’t worry. Wèi-xiōng is still alive.”</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>In a gentle and sympathetic manner, Lán SīZhuī said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, you haven’t eaten anything for quite a while. Why don’t you go to the kitchen, so that the cook could serve you something to eat. Jīn Líng and I will stay here to watch over Wèi qiánbèi.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “I don’t need anything.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng and Lán SīZhuī exchanged a glance, and the latter shook his head in despair.</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng hesitantly said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, you... you only slept for three hours. Why don’t you rest a little bit more. SīZhuī and I will be waiting outside along with JǐngYí.”</p>
        <p>Noticing that the bed was wide enough, Jīn Líng wanted to add “You could sleep with Wèi WúXiàn”, but, on second thoughts, he bit his tongue.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī simply replied, “I’m fine. Don’t worry. Xiōng-zhǎng* has transferred in me some of his spiritual power.”</p>
        <small>*Lán WàngJī refers to his elder brother, Lán XīChén, also known as Zéwú-Jūn.</small>
        <p>Soon after Jīn Líng and Lán SīZhuī left the room, Lán WàngJī stood up from his chair, and went to sit on the bed. He held Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, closed his eyes and began to meditate.</p>
        <p>Was he tired? Yes, indeed, he was extremely tired. However, he didn’t want to fall asleep and miss the moment Wèi WúXiàn would wake up.</p>
        <p>Somehow, it seemed to Lán WàngJī that he constantly looked for Wèi WúXiàn. During the Shooting Sun campaign, Wèi WúXiàn went missing for three months since no one knew that he was thrown into the pit of the mass burial. After the bloodbath of Nightless Sky City, for thirteen years, he had looked and waited for Wèi WúXiàn to return.</p>
        <p>When Wèi WúXiàn came back, Lán WàngJī swore to protect him. However, despite his protection, Wèi WúXiàn was stabbed by Jīn Líng, and went into a coma for four days.</p>
        <p>Luckily, this time, it only took two days to find Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>And, two days had passed since Lán WàngJī took the unconscious Wèi WúXiàn back to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, after the examination, the doctor didn’t find any internal injury, saying that you had protected your vital organs. In other words, there is nothing serious about your health condition.</p>
        <p>“So, please wake up soon. I miss you.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Outside, Jīn Líng, Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí were sitting on the porch of Jingshi*, and facing the front garden of the house, in which there were various types of plants.</p>
        <small>*Jingshi is the name of the dwelling of Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn.</small>
        <p>It seemed that Wèi WúXiàn had taken a liking to planting many different kinds of vegetation; he would, for instance, on one day dig a small pool for lotus plants, and on another day he would make a small squared field to grow watermelons, and so on.</p>
        <p>Moreover, here and there, there were different varieties of flowering plants, which offered a beautiful spring view.</p>
        <p>The front garden of Jingshi did no longer look like the previous plain garden.</p>
        <p>However, this splendid view was not enough to soothe Jīn Líng from being restless, plucking the flower stem of an orchid, he began to fidget with it, while Lán JǐngYí glared angrily at him for plucking the orchid, when, suddenly, they heard Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you’re awake.”</p>
        <p>The three of them rushed to get into the room, Lán JǐngYí tripped over the threshold and fell on the floor, Jīn Líng jumped over him and dashed towards the bed.</p>
        <p>Although his eyes were wide open, Wèi WúXiàn’s vision was blurred. Covering his forehead with one hand, and, with an alarming voice, he cried, “A child! There is a child!”</p>
        <p>Then, he raised his head, and, finally, he began to see clearly. He said, “It’s you, Lán Zhàn? Lán Zhàn, save the child, save the little baby.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī held his hand and said, “The baby is safe and sound. I found her by tracking your signal-transfer talisman. Right now, she is at the convent, and the nuns are taking care of her.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Oh, really?”</p>
        <p>Feeling a sudden sharp pain in his head as he tried to recall what happened, Wèi WúXiàn pressed his fingers on his temples, he had a vague recollection of the baby, however, he could not remember exactly who that baby was.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí had also reached the sickbed, Lán JǐngYí said, “Wèi qiánbèi, you scared us to death.”</p>
        <p>In a reproachful tone, Jīn Líng said, “Why are you always acting so recklessly? Are you still a kid or what?”</p>
        <p>Perplexed, Wèi WúXiàn looked at the three young boys, and noted that one was wearing a golden gown with a beautifully embroidered white peony on the chest, while the other two were wearing GūsūLán’s uniforms; a white gown with broad sleeves, an ornamental pendant dangling from the waist-belt, and a forehead ribbon with the curl cloud motifs.</p>
        <p>The three of them were looking at him with concern.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Who are you?”,  casting a quick look across the room, he added,  “And, where am I?” </p>
        <p>With a great astonishment, they all stared at Wèi WúXiàn in disbelief.</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng asked, “You don’t recognise me?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn looked carefully at the handsome young boy with a red dot on the forehead, and noticed that he bore a faint resemblance to Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>He replied, “Sorry, I have a poor memory. I don’t recall seeing you before.”</p>
        <p>Not losing a moment, Lán JǐngYí asked, “Wèi qiánbèi, what about me? Don’t you remember me?”</p>
        <p>In a dispirited tone, Lán SīZhuī said, “Wèi qiánbèi, it’s me, SīZhuī.”</p>
        <p>With great attention, Wèi WúXiàn looked in turn at the two elegant boys of the young generation of the GūsūLán clan, then he shook his head in negation.</p>
        <p>Irritated, Jīn Líng thundered, “Wèi WúXiàn, if you are joking again, I’ll---”, he suddenly realised that Lán WàngJī was in the room, and quickly shut his mouth in panic.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn followed Jīn Líng’s gaze, as the latter cast a quick look at Lán WàngJī, who, in this room, was the only person Wèi WúXiàn knew.</p>
        <p>Then, all of a sudden, he asked, “Lán Zhàn, why are you looking so pale?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī, to whom the loss of Wèi WúXiàn’s memories came as a great blow, slowly began to loose his fist that he had clenched in shock. “At least, he still remember me.”, he said inwardly.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī gently said, “Wèi Yīng, this room’s name is Jingshi, it’s one of the dwellings of the GūsūLán residence. Right now, you are at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.”</p>
        <p>After a short pause, Lán WàngJī asked, “Wèi Yīng, what do you remember?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then tried hard to recall what he recently did or planned to do. There were buzzing noises inside his head, then, with a confusing mind, he suddenly cried, “Jīn Líng! I’m going to see Jīn Líng! The baby! I have to save the baby!”</p>
        <p>Then, he grabbed Lán WàngJīi’s sleeve, and asked, “Why do I remember that there is a baby who needs help? Is it Jīn Líng? Quick, take me to Jīnlíntái*!”</p>
        <small>*Jīnlíntái is the residence of the LánlíngJīn sect.</small>
        <p>Lán WàngJī held Wèi WúXiàn’s both hands, then said, “Wèi Yīng, calm down. It’s not Jīn Líng. It’s a baby girl whom you have already saved.”</p>
        <p>He resumed after a short pause, “Wèi Yīng, you had been washed away by the flood, then you went into a coma for four days. As a result, you have developed amnesia.”</p>
        <p>Pausing again to let Wèi WúXiàn understand the situation, Lán WàngJī once more reassured him, “Don’t worried for the baby girl. She is now at the GūsūLán’s convent.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn murmured to himself, “It’s not Jīn Líng.”</p>
        <p>Then, he looked up at Lán WàngJī, and said, “So, the one I rescued is not Jīn Líng but a baby girl.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Yes, that’s right.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then asked, “Is the baby safe now?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “She is safe and sound. Later on, I’ll send someone to bring the baby here so you can see her for yourself.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “And, what about Jīn Líng?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī cast a look at Jīn Líng, then replied, “Jīn Líng is also safe and sound.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī’s voice was deep and pleasing to the ear, it had a relaxing effect on Wèi WúXiàn’s anxious mind.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn finally calmed himself down, and appeared to be relieved. He said inwardly, “Since Lán Zhàn said that Jīn Líng is fine, then it must be true.” The noises inside his head began gradually to vanish.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī asked, “Wèi Yīng, what are your most recent memories? For example, what did happen yesterday or today? Or, what did you plan on doing tomorrow?”</p>
        <p>Carefully, Wèi WúXiàn tried to recollect his memories, then said, “The full month banquet! Tomorrow, I’m going to attend Jīn Líng’s one-month-old banquet.”</p>
        <p>Somehow, Wèi WúXiàn could not explain why it didn’t feel strange the fact that Lán WàngJī, who was sitting beside him, still holding his both hands.</p>
        <p>With his head tilted to one side, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Lán Zhàn, are you coming as well?”</p>
        <p>Then, all of a sudden, he became very agitated again, he cried, “The silver orb! Where is the silver orb? You said that I was washed away by the flood, then, the sliver orb that I had on my sleeve is lost!”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng who, until now, was sulking could no longer hold his tongue, he asked, “What kind of silver orb?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn looked at Jīn Líng and sensed some sort of familiarity with him, he said, “I think there is no harm in telling you. It is the full month gift that I carved for Jīn Líng. It has a powerful charm to ward off evil spirits.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng became overwhelmed with emotion, which brought tears in his eyes. He took off his ring and handed it over to Wèi WúXiàn, while asking, “Is this ring has the same kind of the charm you just mentioned?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn took the ring and slightly stroked the golden stars engraved on it, then said, “Indeed, it has a similar charm, which is slightly better than the one I made.”</p>
        <p>“Oh!” he added, “Besides warding off evil spirits, the ring has other spells added into it.” </p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn carried on examining the ring, then said, “The person who made this charm is a genius, who is fairly better than me.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng took a deep breath, exchanged a glance with Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí, then, looking straight at Wèi WúXiàn, he calmly said, “I am Jīn Líng.”</p>
        <p>As Wèi WúXiàn got puzzled by what he just heard, Lán WàngJī briefly explained him the situation.</p>
        <p>“So, what you mean is...” Wèi WúXiàn remarked while eating the bowl of congee that Lán WàngJī served him, “... as I woke up from the coma, I have lost twenty years of memories.”</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, is it true?” he asked after a short pause.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “Yes, it’s true.”</p>
        <p>After finishing the bowl of congee, Wèi WúXiàn felt that his mind was completely cleared up, he said, “This is really interesting.”</p>
        <p>With a smile on his face, Wèi WúXiàn looked at Jīn Líng, then he said, “In other words, I didn’t see Jīn Líng when he was a baby, however, right now, I have in front of me the grown-up Jīn Líng.”</p>
        <p>Unsure, Jīn Líng asked, “Do you really accept as true that I am Jīn Líng?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn replied, “Of course, I do. Why should I not accept it since HánGuāng-Jūn already said that it’s true?”</p>
        <p>“Hmm! The congee was really delicious.” Wèi WúXiàn remarked, “Lán Zhàn, GūsūLán has improved the taste of its cooking.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī served him another bowl of congee.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn carried on, “Jīn Líng, to tell the truth, you look a little bit like your father, and a little bit like Jiāng Chéng. You even carry Suìhuá*. ”</p>
        <small>*Suìhuá is the sword of Jīn Líng’s father.</small>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn began to toss the ring up into the air, while saying, “Besides a genius like myself, I wonder who else is capable of making such a powerful charm.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng was speechless, for an instance, he felt that Wèi WúXiàn didn’t lose his memories.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn gave back the ring to Jīn Líng, and asked, “What is the name of your ring?”</p>
        <p>“Golden Lightning.” replied Jīn Líng.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “This name is really dull. Can’t you come up with another better name?”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng replied, “For example, The Supreme Mythical Peerless Precious Ring.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Yes, why not?”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng rolled his eyes in disbelief.</p>

    <div>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled, then said, “So, you came here for me, waiting until I woke up. As for me, I had prepared a present for you. In other words, you and I have a good relationship.”</p>
        <p>“What about your mother?” Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Where is she? Is she all right?”</p>
        <p>Instantly, a dead silence fell into the room.</p>
        <p>However, before Lán WàngJī could step in, Jīn Líng had already collected himself, and, like a shooting star, he replied, “She has gone to the eastern regions along with father.</p>
        <p>“Since you wanted absolutely to protect the last Wēn clan, mother wanted to protect you. Therefore, father decided to send them to the eastern regions, where he found a new place for them to settle.</p>
        <p>“From time to time, mother and father go there to pay them a visit on your behalf.”</p>
        <p>“A few years ago,  father was tired of whole clan’s affairs,” carried on Jīn Líng, “he wanted to spend more time with mother, so he designated me to become the leader our clan, then, along with mother, they have set off on journey, sightseeing the eastern regions.”</p>
        <p>Out of the blue, Jīn Líng said all those lies, causing Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí to be so dumbfounded that they didn’t even dare to move a muscle.</p>
        <p>“Is Jīn ZiXuān* that amazing?” Wèi WúXiàn seemed to talk to himself rather asking. Then, after a short pause of thinking, he added, “That’s right! Occasionally, he shows some courage.”</p>
        <small>*Jīn ZiXuān is Jīn Líng’s father.</small>
        <p>He then asked, “Lán Zhàn, is what Jīn Líng said true?”</p>
        <p>Anxious, Jīn Líng clenched his fists tight, waiting to see if Lán WàngJī would cooperate or not. Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí were also nervous.</p>
        <p>In a deep voice, Lán WàngJī replied, “Yes.”</p>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn quickly asked, “Then, what about me? Since the last Wēn clan left for eastern regions, what has become of me?”</p>
        <p>Cocksure, Jīn Líng replied, “You have joined our LánlíngJīn sect, and become my underling.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī glanced at Jīn Líng, and the latter, feeling embarrassed, lowered his head.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn observed Lán WàngJī’s expression, and, with a smile on his face, he said, “That was a lie. However, according to what you said before, I’ve probably rejoined the YúnmèngJiāng sect.”</p>
        <p>While he carried on eating, Wèi WúXiàn said, “This congee is really tasty. Some fish has been added into it. What kind of fish is it?”</p>
        <p>“It’s dace fillets.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “It’s so tender and delicious. Has this dish always been part of GūsūLán cooking?”</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly something crossed his mind, he said: “Eh! Lán Zhàn, why you haven’t said yet ‘Don’t speak while eating’?”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng spoke before Lán WàngJī could reply, “Hey! If you can walk, let’s go to the Elegant Room after you finish eating. My uncle is there. He has been waiting for you to wake up.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Your uncle? Oh, you mean Jiāng Chéng.”, then he realised, “Wait a minute! Why did you use ‘hey’ to call me, while you called Jiāng Chéng ‘uncle’? Am I not also your uncle?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī cast a look at Jīn Líng.</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng reluctantly said, “All right! I’ll call you ‘uncle Wèi’, and keep calling him ‘uncle’.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “It sounds like you are more closer to Jiāng Chéng than me. A-Líng*, I had made a powerful charm just for you. Why don’t you also form a strong attachment to me?”</p>
        <small>*A in A-Líng is prefix used before the “first name”, it indicates a close relationship. (It’s pronounced like the letter ‘a’ in the word ‘cat’.)</small>
        <p>“Uncle gave me a spiritual dog.” replied Jīn Líng.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “A spiritual dog.”</p>
        <p>“That’s right!” said Jīn Líng, “I’ve already had a male spiritual dog. Uncle said that I could mate it with another dog, so he gave me a female spiritual dog.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng carried on, “Maybe, next year, I will have a litter of puppies.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn hopelessly said, “All right! There’s no need to compare the gift that Jiāng Chéng gave you with mine.”</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, wait before going to the Elegant Room. I’m going to send someone to bring the baby girl here.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn replied, “Okay.”</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī signed to Lán JǐngYí and Jīn Líng to follow him outside.</p>
        <p>As they three left the room, Wèi WúXiàn began to chat with Lán SīZhuī, while eating his bowl of congee.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, as they reached the gate of Jingshi courtyard, Lán WàngJī said to Lán JǐngYí not to tell anyone about Wèi WúXiàn’s amnesia, then sent him to the convent.</p>
        <p>He then waited until Lán JǐngYí was out of earshot, and then asked Jīn Líng, “How did you come up with that made-up story?”</p>
        <p>Lowering his head, Jīn Líng replied, “For the past few years, I have been thinking that if, that day, uncle Yáo* had succeeded in escaping to eastern regions that would be good.” </p>
        <small>*Jīn Líng refers to his father’s brother, Jīn GuāngYáo, who failed to get away from his countless crimes.</small>
        <p>Jīn Líng cast a quick look at Lán WàngJī, and, as he noticed that the latter was not displeased with what he just said, he carried on, “Last year, on my birthday banquet, Wèi WúXiàn and you told me that my parents were the most kind-hearted people, that my father was wonderful and reliable person.</p>
        <p>“That night of my birthday, I dreamt of my father. In my dream, father saved SīZhuī, he also saved Wèi WúXiàn and mother. Many other people were also saved by him. In that dream, my father became a great hero.</p>
        <p>“Ever since, I have that dream going on and on in my head. So, earlier, somehow, all those words spontaneously came out of my mouth.”</p>
        <p>Then, he hesitantly asked, “Will..., uh, will he be able to recover his memories?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Is it not a good thing that he doesn’t remember all those painful memories?” remarked Jīn Líng.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “One must face the facts, even though those facts are hard to surmount.” then, he added, “Go ahead to the Elegant Room, and inform Leader Jiāng about the current state of Wèi Yīng.”</p>
        <p>“All right.” said Jīn Líng, “I’ll also tell him to keep it secret.” </p>
        <br />
        <p>… … …</p>
        <br />
        <p>An irregular yet charming mountain landscape, which, throughout the year, was surrounded by the white clouds, was the spectacular view offered by the GūsūLán residence. Being part of it was like living in a fairyland.</p>
        <p>The early-morning mist had not cleared yet, and, with the exception of the chimes, the surroundings was still and quiet, making one feel completely at ease.</p>
        <p>Even though the place was not a Buddhist temple, still it had the serenity of one.</p>
        <p>On their way to the Elegant Room, Wèi WúXiàn remarked, “Lán Zhàn, Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù has not changed at all.”</p>
        <p>“Uh-huh.” agreed Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>With his memories lost, the amnesia Wèi WúXiàn was happy to see Jīn Líng at last.</p>
        <p>Also, it was a weight off his shoulders learning that the last Wēn clan was safe and sound. He felt relieved and more relaxed, as though he was rescued from a shipwreck.</p>
        <p>A short time ago, he saw the little baby girl. Although he still didn’t remember anything, but just looking at the baby, who was sleeping soundly, with tints of pink on her cheeks, and whom he saved as he learned, made him extremely happy.</p>
        <p>He also saw the doctor, who examined him for a while in an attempt to find the cause of his amnesia but failed.</p>
        <p>By nature, Wèi WúXiàn had always been easy-going. Right now, he had a carefree attitude, feeling restful, and easily accepting that twenty years had passed, in which he had no recollections of it. He just cheerfully went with the flow.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, have you found the parents of that little baby?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“I haven’t.” replied Lán WàngJī, “I asked everyone from Wěishàn Village, they all answered that none of their children are missing.”</p>
        <p>“Oh! In other words, she was abandoned.” said Wèi WúXiàn, “This is so pitiful. When I was a child, and before uncle Jiāng found me, I also was all alone, not because I was abandoned, it was because my parents had passed away.”</p>
        <p>He then asked, “Lán Zhàn, will GūsūLán carry on looking after her?”</p>
        <p>“Of course.” Lán WàngJī replied.</p>
        <p>“To have been given the opportunity to grow up at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù was a blessing.” thought Wèi WúXiàn. Deep down, he appreciated GūsūLán’s kindness towards the little baby.</p>
        <p>When he started to live at Lotus Piers, Wèi WúXiàn grew up among many young brothers and a big sister. So, being an orphan did not affected his childhood at all.</p>
        <p>He was sure that the baby would grow up happily among GūsūLán disciples. There was no need to worry about it.</p>
        <p>He then asked, “Has GūsūLán given her a name?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “Not yet.”</p>
        <p>“In that case, I’ll give her a nickname.” said Wèi WúXiàn, “After all, I was the one who saved her. GūsūLán can call her by her nickname.”</p>
        <p>“All right.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Since she has a round and reddish face, I’ll call her Little Apple*.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <small>*Little Apple is the name Wèi WúXiàn gives to his donkey in the original story.</small>
        <p>At the instant the words ‘Little Apple’ reached his ears, Lán WàngJī stopped abruptly, as if he was struck by lightning.</p>
        <p>Observing Lán WàngJī’s reaction, Wèi WúXiàn said, “You don’t like it? It’s just a nickname. If we call her ‘little angel’ or ‘little baby’, I’m afraid that every little child would think that they have been called. While ‘Little Apple’ is more specific.”</p>
        <p>Collecting himself, Lán WàngJī replied, “It’s perfect.”</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, after twenty years, your personality becomes more gentle. You even said ‘perfect’ to my suggestion. As far as I can remember you’ve never praised me before.” remarked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>He then carried on, “I was washed away by the flood. Was it you who found me?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “It was Niè HuáiSāng who found you. He then notified me.”</p>
        <p>Confused, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Why did he notify you instead of Jiāng Chéng?”</p>
        <p>Ignoring Wèi WúXiàn’s question, Lán WàngJī asked, “Wèi Yīng, do you feel any discomfort anywhere in your body?”</p>
        <p>The sudden change of the topic puzzled Wèi WúXiàn. However, he did not insist on the matter, he simply replied, “Not at all. I had a headache when I woke up. However, right now, I’m feeling completely fine.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “According to what the doctor said, your amnesia is temporary, that you will soon recover your memories.”</p>
        <p>With a complete trust in Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn said, “All right, then. I won’t ask any more questions. I’ll wait until I regain all my lost memories. And when that time comes, everything that I don’t understand now will become clear to me.”</p>
        <p>“We arrived at Elegant Room.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Raising his head, Wèi WúXiàn saw the ‘Elegant Room’ characters written on the top of the entrance. However, he seemed to hesitate to enter the room. </p>
        <p>After they had pretended to severe their relationship, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t know if he was currently on good or bad terms with Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>Earlier, he found it awkward to inquire about it in front of Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí. Unfortunately, Jīn Líng left before he could find the opportunity to told to him alone. </p>
        <p>Noticing Wèi WúXiàn’s hesitation, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, your relationship with Jiāng WǎnYín* has already improved considerably.”</p>
        <small>*Jiāng WǎnYín is Jiāng Chéng’s given name.</small>
        <p>“The issue of the last Wēn clan has already been solved.” said Wèi WúXiàn inwardly, “So, that probably means that Jiāng Chéng and I have been reconciled with each other.”</p>
        <p>He carried on thinking, “To think that Lán Zhàn is so good at observing people really surprised me. He actually knew that I was thinking.”</p>

        <p>As they stepped into the Elegant Room, they found Lán XīChén, Jiāng Chéng and Jīn Líng.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī glanced at Jīn Líng, and the latter nodded to him, signalling that he had already told the other two about Wèi WúXiàn’s amnesia.</p>
        <p>Being by nature very kind and gentle, Lán XīChén was wearing a warm smile on his face. His smile, however, was less bright compared to the smile of Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng was just like in Wèi WúXiàn’s old memories, with thin eyebrows and almond shape-like eyes, a fierce and  penetrating look on his face. When he saw Wèi WúXiàn coming in, his facial expression changed, a change that was hard to describe.</p>
        <p>In a pleasant and friendly tone, Lán XīChén said, “WàngJī and WúXiàn, here you are.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn bowed, and inwardly said, “Just now, Zéwú-Jūn called me ‘WúXiàn’ instead of ‘Wèi-gōngzǐ’*. Do we already have such a close familiarity?”</p>
        <small>*gōngzǐ is a honorific title. The suffix is formal compared to ‘xiōng’ in ‘Wèi-xiōng’, which is informal.</small>
        <p>“Have you seen a doctor?” asked Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>Before Wèi WúXiàn could replied, Lán WàngJī spoke, “He is in good health condition. However, the cause of his amnesia is known. Anyway, the doctor said that he will recover his memories shortly.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng knew that, for Wèi WúXiàn’s sake, Lán WàngJī would certainly request the best doctor. So, there was no need for him to worry about it.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “It doesn’t really matter that I have lost my memories, because I’m still alive and well. So, for the time being, you can tell me, little by little, what happened during these twenty years.”</p>
        <p>“My old boy, are you taking twenty years for few days?” remarked Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>He was aware that, once more, Wèi WúXiàn has lost his golden core, and was very upset about it.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Right now, I’m lacking twenty years of memories. Therefore, compared to all of you, I am twenty years younger than you. So, yes, indeed, I can take twenty years for few days.”</p>
        <p>While smiling, Lán XīChén said, “WúXiàn has always been philosophical. That’s great!” Then, he turned towards Lán WàngJī, and said, “WàngJī, you no longer need to worry about it.”</p>
        <p>With a bright smile on his face, Wèi WúXiàn inquired, “What is he worried about? Oh! I’ve got it!” </p>
        <p>Then, he asked, “Lán Zhàn, are you worried about me?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī cast a glance at his elder brother for help. However, Lán XīChén remained silent while he kept smiling.</p>
        <p>Pushed into the corner, Lán WàngJī replied, “Yes.”.</p>
        <p>“Yes, what?” Wèi WúXiàn playfully teased him.</p>
        <p>“I’m worried about you.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Dumbfounded, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t really expect to hear Lán WàngJī uttered those words.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng stared open-mouthed at the scene that was playing in front of him. He then exchanged glances with Jīn Líng, and then rolled his eyes.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Jīn Líng stealthily told his uncle that he wanted to take Wèi WúXiàn with him back to Jīnlíntái, making Wèi WúXiàn a member of his LánlíngJīn clan.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng told him that there was no way Lán WàngJī would let go of Wèi WúXiàn. He also added that, whether he had lost his memories or not, Wèi WúXiàn would choose to stay with Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Lán XīChén brought a flute and a sword, and said to Wèi WúXiàn, “Suíbiàn is intact, however, since Chénqíng was underwater for twenty four hours, I have carried out a check to make sure that it’s fine.”</p>
        <p>He then added, “WúXiàn, since you woke up, I give them back to you.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was somewhat puzzled, wondering why Lán XīChén would take care of his flute and sword. Nevertheless, he respectfully took Suíbiàn and Chénqíng, and said, “Thank you very much, Zéwú-Jūn.”</p>
        <p>“It was WàngJī who found them.” said Lán XīChén.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn only said, “Oh!”</p>
        <p>He unconsciously did not express his gratitude towards Lán WàngJī, since they both have already agreed that, between them, there was no need for it. He then hanged his sword and flute on his waist-belt.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, did you specially go there to look for them?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“I wasn’t only looking for them. I was also searching for you.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Wow! Apparently, you have been really concerned about me.” then, he added, “Lán Zhàn, you become more honest now.”</p>
        <p>Since they were teenagers, Jiāng Chéng knew how Wèi WúXiàn enjoyed teasing Lán WàngJī. Right now, observing Wèi WúXiàn’s mood brought Jiāng Chéng back to those old days.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, as Jiāng Chéng watched Wèi WúXiàn who started again to tease Lán WàngJī, the back then images of the two and the present scene in front of him overlapped each other.</p>
        <p>All of a sudden, he said, “Wèi WúXiàn, I want to talk to you in private.” having no desire of wasting time.</p>
        <p>In an instant, the smile on Wèi WúXiàn’s face froze, Jīn Líng became nervous, and Lán XīChén put his hand on Lán WàngJī’s shoulder by means of soothing him.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng and Wèi WúXiàn left the Elegant Room, and walked until they arrived at a pavilion located next to the mountain path.</p>
        <p>From the pavilion, there was a beautiful view of an array of trees at the base of the mountains. Nearby, wildflowers released their delicate fragrance that spread around the pavilion.</p>
        <p>However, the two people inside the pavilion, having their minds full of concerns, failed to appreciate the beauty of their surroundings.</p>
        <p>Earlier, in Jingshi, because he was not familiar with Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí,  Wèi WúXiàn, despite having many questions to ask, decided to wait until he got the opportunity for it.</p>
        <p>And, right now, he had the opportunity, and opted for a topic which was less sensitive.</p>
        <p>“Jiāng Chéng, why was I washed away by the flood?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng replied, “After the dragon that was hidden deep in a pond flew away, a torrential rain began to pour down. This heavy rain caused flash floods that inundated many downstream locations.</p>
        <p>“You went to Ankang River, and, using your demonic power, you built a barrier that held the flow of water back. However, when the barrier collapsed, you were carried by the turbulent river.”</p>
        <p>“Wow! I’m quite heroic.” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>And Jiāng Chéng rolled his eyes.</p>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn was deep in thought, “I actually went to Ankang River to build a barrier. And, Ankang is located close to the upper reaches of Han River. And, Han River flows across the whole territory of Yúnmèng.</p>
        <p>“In other words, I was in charge of handling Yúnmèng issues. That means that Jiāng Chéng really trusted me to tackle those issues.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Right now, what is the situation of the flooded areas?”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng replied, “Fortunately, the heavy rain only lasted twenty four hours. After that, the sky cleared up.</p>
        <p>“The upper reaches of Han River’s issues were successfully handled by Lán WàngJī together with you. As for the lower reaches, safety precautions have been taken in advance.</p>
        <p>“In the end, it was more frightened than hurt.”</p>
        <p>Surprised, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Did I go there along with Lán Zhàn?”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng looked disgustingly at him, while grinding his teeth. Then, he replied, “Yes.”</p>
        <p>“So, that means that we both get along perfectly fine, then.” remarked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>With a sneer, Jiāng Chéng said, “You both get along better than you think.” Then, he inwardly said, “You two got married, and your surname becomes ‘Lán Wèi’.”</p>
        <p>With a smile on his face, Wèi WúXiàn said, “You didn’t believe me when I said that he definitely likes me.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng was lost for words. Back then, he strongly believed that Lán WàngJī hated Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then said, “Usually, water ghouls emerge after a flood. As the leader, should you not be there, preventing those water ghouls from harming people?”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng replied, “Because someone went into a coma that, in order to check on him, I have to fly on my sword to get here, after patrolling the whole area. And, by chance, today, that person finally happened to wake up.”</p>
        <p>Listening to Jiāng Chéng’s words warmed Wèi WúXiàn’s heart, he said, “Sect Leader Jiāng is a high-minded gentleman. Thank you for the hard work.”</p>
        <p>In his friendly disposition, Wèi WúXiàn put his arm around Jiāng Chéng’s shoulders, and gave him a little punch to the stomach. Just like when they were teenagers.</p>
        <p>Since he didn’t expect to see Wèi WúXiàn behaving in this way towards him, Jiāng Chéng was stunned. He then quickly regained his composure, and punched back.</p>
        <p>Having passed through so many years of hardship, which had devastated their happy memories of when they used to put their arms around each other shoulders, now, finally, all those bad days were swept away by the howling gale.</p>
        <p>With the mountain breeze blowing on his face, Jiāng Chéng remained silent.</p>
        <p>Still having his arm around Jiāng Chéng’s shoulders, Wèi WúXiàn noticed the change in Jiāng Chéng’s mood. However, he did not remove his arm around his shoulders. Jiāng Chéng, on the other hand, did not push him away either.</p>
        <p>After a while, Jiāng Chéng asked, “Don’t you have something you want to tell me?”</p>
        <p>“I am the one here who has lost his memories. Shouldn’t it be you who has a lot tell me?” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Noticing that Jiāng Chéng’s expression had suddenly changed, Wèi WúXiàn had second thoughts. He said inwardly, “For things I still want to know, I think I’d better ask Lán Zhàn, later on, rather than asking Jiāng Chéng.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng said, “Don’t you think that things, which were concealed, would not be revealed during all these twenty years?”</p>
        <p>Puzzled, Wèi WúXiàn removed his arm around Jiāng Chéng’s shoulders, and, by joking, he said, “I think you have got taller than me. It becomes a little bit hard for me to put my arm around your shoulders.”</p>
        <p>Inwardly, Jiāng Chéng said, “That’s because your former physical appearance has been substituted with a shorter one.”</p>
        <p>Then, aloud, he said, “Don’t change the subject.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn remained silent for a while, then said, “I don’t know what you are referring to.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, really?” retorted Jiāng Chéng. Then he said, “Give me your sword.”</p>
        <p>“Suíbiàn?!”, exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, “Why do you want it for?”</p>
        <p>“Lend it to me.” insisted Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn took off Suíbiàn from his waist-belt, and handed it to Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>While taking the sword, Jiāng Chéng was thinking of the fact that Wèi WúXiàn had formed a new golden core, however, because of Yúnmèng flash floods, his golden core was shattered into pieces. He was very upset, and didn’t know who to blame for it.</p>
        <p>Then, he tried to pull out the sword, but couldn’t unsheathe Suíbiàn.</p>
        <p>Using his spiritual power, Jiāng Chéng tried again to draw Suíbiàn. However, he was still unable to pull it out.</p>
        <p>All of a sudden, Jiāng Chéng annoyingly burst into laugher. Then, without turning his head, he called out loudly, “HánGuāng-Jūn, where are you?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn turned his head and looked, but he didn’t see anyone.</p>
        <p>“Lán WàngJī is definitely nearby. Call him to come over here.” said Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn could not make heads or tails of what Jiāng Chéng was up to. Nevertheless, turning towards the mountain path, he called out, “Lán Zhàn, are you around? Can you come over here?”</p>
        <p>Soon after, Lán WàngJī came out from the grove at the foot of the mountain, and walked up slowly.</p>
        <p>Indeed, he was close by, choosing a spot in which he would not be within earshot. However, since he was somehow connected to Wèi WúXiàn, he was able to hear Wèi WúXiàn calling him.</p>
        <p>Intuitively, Jiāng Chéng sensed that something was off. With a sneer, he pointed Suíbiàn towards Lán WàngJī, and said, “Pull it out.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī had already understood the meaning behind Jiāng Chéng’s actions. He took Suíbiàn, and slowly began to pull it out. Instantly, as Lán WàngJī progressively drew Suíbiàn* from its sheath, the reflection of light on the surface of the sword blade shone brightly.</p>
        <small>*Suíbiàn sealed itself after Wèi WúXiàn’s death. However, apart from Wèi WúXiàn, Jiāng Chéng was the only one to draw Suíbiàn, because, the years prior to his death, when Jiāng Chéng’s golden core had been melted, Wèi WúXiàn secretly gave him his own golden core.</small>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng exclaimed, “What’s the meaning of this?”</p>
        <p>Still in the dark, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “What on earth are you both playing at?”</p>
        <p>Then, Jiāng Chéng stormed, “Wèi WúXiàn, don’t you want to know where you have been, and what you have been doing during all these years?”</p>
        <p>Both Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn looked nervously at Jiāng Chéng.</p>

        <p>“After destroying the ‘Tiger Talisman’, you died.</p>
        <p>“Seven years ago, Mò XuánYǔ, the illegitimate son of Jīn GuāngShàn*, summoned you by offering his own body.</p>
        <small>*Jīn GuāngShàn is the former leader of LánlíngJīn sect, and Jīn Líng’s grandfather.</small>
        <p>“However, people still consider you as an evil heretic, thinking that Lán WàngJī protects you because he is possessed by your evil spirit.</p>
        <p>“Ever since you came back, you have been with Lán WàngJī day and night, doing everything together with him.” uttered Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn turned towards Lán WàngJī and asked, “All this Jiāng Chéng just said, is it true?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “Yes.”</p>
        <p>Then, inwardly, he said, “Indeed, everything that was said is true, but the most important thing is left out. His account doesn’t contain all the facts.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was stunned by those revelations, inwardly he went over, “I have been with Lán Zhàn continuously, like two people living together. Moreover, people are still seeing me like a devil, and, in order to protect me, Lán Zhàn compromises himself.”</p>
        <p>Then, aloud, he quickly said, “Jiāng Chéng, let’s go back for now. We’ll talk about it once get home.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng stared blankly at Wèi WúXiàn, and when he spoke, he sounded a bit hoarse, “You want to go back to Lotus Piers with me?!”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn replied, “Yes, of course. We---”</p>
        <p>At that instant, Wèi WúXiàn noticed Lán WàngJī’s expression, and couldn’t finish his sentence. Such deep sorrow that he read on his face was unbearable.</p>
        <p>Forgetting that Lán WàngJī once told him that he didn’t like physical contact, Wèi WúXiàn held Lán WàngJī’s hand, and, in haste, he said, “Lán Zhàn, why are you so sad? You look so dreadful. If you want me to stay, then I’ll stay with you. As for what happened during these past years, you can tell me about it later on.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng then examined Lán WàngJī’s face, however, all he could see was the usual poker-faced expression that Lán WàngJī always wore on his face.</p>
        <p>Inwardly he said, “How on earth Wèi WúXiàn managed to see any sadness on Lán WàngJī’s face? Furthermore, I don’t see him looking dreadful at all.”</p>
        <p>Turning towards Jiāng Chéng, Lán WàngJī said, “Leader Jiāng, may I have a word with you?”</p>
        <p>Leaving the two of them in the pavilion, Wèi WúXiàn walked down the mountain path, and stood at the same spot where Lán WàngJī was standing earlier.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng’s account was still running through his mind, “Lán Zhàn and I live together. People still hate me. So, Lán Zhàn protects me.</p>
        <p>“Perhaps the reason why we live together is that some people want to kill me, so Lán Zhàn is protecting me day and night like a bodyguard. Lán Zhàn, why are you willing to go so far?”</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in the pavilion, Jiāng Chéng sneered, “HánGuāng-Jūn, you are so lucky. Although, Wèi WúXiàn has lost his memories, he still likes you so much.”</p>
        <p>Indifferent to Jiāng Chéng’s sarcasm, Lán WàngJī said, “Yes, indeed, I am lucky.”</p>
        <p>Taken by surprise, Jiāng Chéng’s mouth was agape at Lán WàngJī’s remark.</p>
        <p>Then, after a while, he asked, “Are you not going to tell him that you both are already married?”</p>
        <p>“I have not as yet planned on telling him.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng resolved not to interfere on their marital matter. He then asked, “Why couldn’t I draw Suíbiàn?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “The properties of Wèi Yīng’s golden core have been modified.”</p>
        <p>In a husky voice, Jiāng Chéng said, “Didn’t you say before that his golden core was shattered into pieces?”</p>
        <p>“I had examined his golden core vessel, yesterday, and noted that there’s still a chance.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Delighted, Jiāng Chéng asked, “There’s still a chance to reconstruct his golden core?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “The chance of rebuilding a golden core is within seven days. Four days has already passed since his golden core has been damaged. There’s still three days to reconstruct it.”</p>
        <p>In one go, Jiāng Chéng eagerly asked multiple questions, “Are you sure of that? How can you be so certain about your diagnosis? And, more importantly, how did Wèi WúXiàn manage to form a golden core in the first place?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī remained silent for a while, then, he baldly replied, “Through the dual cultivation.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng fell into stunned silence.</p>
        <p>Then, he inwardly said, “I see. It is no wonder that his golden core’s properties have been changed.”</p>
        <p>He then thought of what Lán WàngJī said before, “Lán WàngJī said that he had examined Wèi WúXiàn’s golden core vessel to see if it was possible to reconstruct his golden core.</p>
        <p>“In other words, Wèi WúXiàn has been practising the dual cultivation with Lán WàngJī.” Jiāng Chéng kept on repeating this last sentence in his mind.</p>
        <p>After a while, he sincerely said, “Thank you for all you have done for him.”</p>
        <p>Ever since Wèi WúXiàn had returned, this was the first time that Jiāng Chéng spoke to Lán WàngJī without being sarcastic.</p>
        <br />
        <p>… … … </p>
        <br />
        <p>As Lán WàngJī joined Wèi WúXiàn, the latter asked, “Where is Jiāng Chéng?”</p>
        <p>“He has left.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>After learning about the dual cultivation, and being aware of what it implied, Jiāng Chéng felt awkward. He was so embarrassed that he knew that he wouldn’t be able to make eye contact with Wèi WúXiàn. Since he had other matters to attend to, he took it as an excuse to leave straight away.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “He left without saying goodbye. And, what about Jīn Líng?”</p>
        <p>“They left together.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Oh! I almost forgot. Jīn Líng is also a sect leader.” said Wèi WúXiàn, somehow, he could not help but feel disappointed for not seeing Jīn Líng one more time. He added, “I wanted to talk to him once more.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Jīn Líng will probably come again tomorrow.” then he asked, “Wèi Yīng, do you want to see the rabbits?”</p>
        <p>Surprised, Wèi WúXiàn said, “There are rabbits at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù!”</p>
        <p>“Back then, you gave me two rabbits. Afterwards, I brought some more of them. Now, there are many rabbits living around here.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>With a smile, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, you really like rabbits.”</p>
        <p>While he was waiting in the grove, Wèi WúXiàn gave some thought to all he had learned, “I have seen and been informed about people I care the most. I really don’t care about other people or matters.</p>
        <p>“And, since I will soon recover my memories, there’s no need of asking too many questions. I’ll just go with the flow.</p>
        <p>“If Lán Zhàn wants to tell me about things I have forgotten, I’ll be all ears. On the other hand, if he doesn’t want to say anything, that’s all right by me.</p>
        <p>“However, if it turns out that Lán Zhàn is compelled to protect me, I will find other place to stay.”</p>
        <p>Following the white stone path, the two of them arrived at the meadow, where many fluffy white rabbits surrounded a big tree. Most of them were sleeping, while a few were moving around, with their three pink petals-like noses, and their long pinkish white ears that they fluttered from time to time.</p>
        <p>Amazed, Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “Wow! That’s quite a lot!”</p>
        <p>Wakened by the sound of Wèi WúXiàn’s voice, the rabbits began to gather around Lán WàngJī, some were climbing on his white boots, others were running around him, making one wondered why they were so excited.</p>
        <p>As they kept surrounding Lán WàngJī, some rabbits, standing on their hind legs, tried to climb further up on Lán WàngJī’s legs.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī picked up a rabbit and held it in his arms. With his slender fingers, he gently scratched the chin of the rabbit.</p>
        <p>In response to Lán WàngJī’s touch, the rabbit rested its long ears alongside its back, and narrowed its ruby-like eyes into small slits, apparently, very pleased by the stroke.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then caressed the head of the rabbit. However, the latter moved its head away from Wèi WúXiàn’s touch.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, this rabbit avoids me. It doesn’t like me at all.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī handed the white rabbit to him. And, with a happy smile, Wèi WúXiàn took the rabbit into his arms.</p>
        <p>Immediately, the rabbit began to toss and turn. Wèi WúXiàn tugged on its ears, then he was about to scratch the rabbit’s belly that Lán WàngJī restrained his hand.</p>
        <p>Interlacing his fingers with Wèi WúXiàn’s so to form a hand of ten fingers, Lán WàngJī guided Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, and they both gently stroked the back of the fluffy rabbit.</p>
        <p>Since he was accustomed to Lán WàngJī’s touch, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t find this physical contact unusual at all.</p>
        <p>Shortly, the white rabbit stopped wriggling, it rested peacefully in Wèi WúXiàn’s arms, and, once more, narrowed its eyes.</p>
        <p>In a soft voice, Lán WàngJī said, “Look, it likes you.”</p>
        <p>At that moment, a young boy, holding a basket, was coming towards them. The boy was wearing a GūsūLán uniform with a forehead ribbon without curl cloud motifs*.</p>
        <small>*Only the family members wear the ribbon with curl cloud motifs.</small>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, there is no need in letting many people know that you have lost your memories, since you will recover them soon.”</p>
        <p>“All right.” agreed Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Presently, the youngster came closer, and respectfully bowed to each of them in turn, “HánGuāng-Jūn. Wèi qiánbèi.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn caught a glimpse of carrots and cabbages inside the basket. While smiling, he remarked, “You came to feed the rabbits.”</p>
        <p>“Yes.” the young boy replied. Then, he picked up some carrots and cabbages, and handed them to Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn took the vegetables, and crouched down to feed the rabbits.</p>
        <p>The young boy said, “Wèi qiánbèi, SīZhuī shīxiōng* said that you are doing fine now.”</p>
        <small>*shīxiōng means senior (male) in any kind of disciplines (such as martial art).</small>
        <p>“Yes. I’m all right.” replied Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“That’s great!” the boy said. Then, in a shy way, he added, “Wèi qiánbèi, we were really worried about you. Please, be more careful in the future.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Am I not in good shape right now?”</p>
        <p>“Will you ...” the boy seemed to hesitate, then asked, “For our next month exam, will you be able to come and supervise us?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn glanced at Lán WàngJī, and the latter nodded his head, then Wèi WúXiàn replied, “I’ll be there.”</p>
        <p>The boy’s lips upturned into a smile. He then joyfully said, “We will work hard.”</p>
        <p>Then, the two of them fed the rabbits until they emptied the basket. And then, the young boy bowed, picked up his basket and off he went.</p>

    <div>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn sat down on the grass, raised his head and looked at Lán WàngJī, he smiled, then he said, “Lán Zhàn, the young GūsūLán’s disciples are well mannered. That young boy was very polite even to me, an evil heretic.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī slightly frowned and said, “Wèi Yīng, you are not an evil heretic.” He then held out his hand to help Wèi WúXiàn stand up.</p>
        <p>This time, Wèi WúXiàn was conscious of an intimate sensation produced while Lán WàngJī was holding his hand.</p>
        <p>Then, he remembered, “Lán Zhàn, don’t you dislike touching other people?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī looked straight in Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes and said, “You are precious to me.”</p>
        <p>Besides what Lán WàngJī said to him, Wèi WúXiàn was mostly dazzled by Lán WàngJī’s gorgeous eyes; the golden irises of Lán WàngJī’s eyes were sparkling like a myriad of tiny little stars in the sky.</p>
        <p>He said, “That’s right. We both live together. Is it in that room named Jingshi where we live?”</p>
        <p>“Yes” replied Lán WàngJī, “Do you want to have a look at the room once more?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn replied, “Yes, why not. Anyway, right now, we don’t have anything else to do.”</p>
        <p>As he began to move forward, his leg failed to follow. This was due to not only because his legs went numb while he was squatting to feed the rabbits, but also because of Lán WàngJī’s words, (“You are precious to me.”), were still rumbling inside his head, making him sluggish.</p>
        <p>As he was about to fall, Lán WàngJī caught him just in time.</p>
        <p>“I had been crouching for too long, and my legs have gone numb.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī slightly knitted his brow and said, “You have an injury on your leg, which was caused by a sword. Apparently, it is not completely healed.”</p>
        <p>Surprised, Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “Really?! I am not at all aware of my own injury. GūsūLán’s ointment for wounds is really effective.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll carry you... on my back.” Lán WàngJī was about to say: I’ll carry you in my arms. However, afraid that he would shock Wèi WúXiàn, Lán WàngJī substituted the words ‘in my arms’ with ‘on my back’.</p>
        <p>Putting his words into action, Lán WàngJī bent down in order to let Wèi WúXiàn get on his back.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn intuitively felt that if he refused to get on his back, Lán WàngJī was capable of doing something else even more embarrassing, in order to carry him.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Wèi WúXiàn was really curious to see how Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù’s disciples would react when they would see Lán WàngJī giving him a piggyback ride back to Jingshi.</p>
        <p>Amused by the eventual priceless expression they might wear on their faces, Wèi WúXiàn got on Lán WàngJī’s back while saying, “Carry me, then.”</p>
        <p>After holding Wèi WúXiàn firmly on his back, Lán WàngJī began to walk slowly.</p>
        <p>Without seeing Lán WàngJī’s expression, Wèi WúXiàn felt that Lán WàngJī’s mood had changed, thinking that maybe he didn’t want to carry him at all.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, put me down. Don’t you think that it’s weird to carry me on your back?” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “You once carried me on your back when we were teenagers.”</p>
        <p>“Did I really do that? I don’t remember.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “It is true. You have just forgotten about it”.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Lán WàngJī carried Wèi WúXiàn until they arrived at their dwelling. And, despite the unusual sight they both were exhibiting, every disciple they had met on their way respectfully saluted them without being shocked.</p>
        <p>Inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn remarked, “GūsūLán sect has still adhered to their strict rules.”</p>
        <p>Once inside the Jingshi, Lán WàngJī made Wèi WúXiàn to sit on a chair, then went to fetch some ointment.</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī returned with the salve, Wèi WúXiàn remarked, “HánGuāng-Jūn, your temperament has changed a lot.”</p>
        <p>“Really? What has changed in me, for instance?” he asked.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn pointed his finger at a white guqin, which was laid on a low table, and said, “I was wondering, did you change your guqin? I remember that you used to have a black one.”</p>
        <p>Knelt in front Wèi WúXiàn,  Lán WàngJī replied while rolling up Wèi WúXiàn’s trouser leg, “That guqin is not mine. It’s yours.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn wasn’t sure of which fact was more surprising; was it because the white guqin actually belonged to him, or because Lán WàngJī crouched down on one knee in front him, for the sake of applying the ointment on his leg?</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, there’s no need for you to do that. I’m fine, I’m really fine.” implored Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī took no heed of his request. He held Wèi WúXiàn’s calf, applied the salve upon the spot of the wound, then he began to massage the area of the injury.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then took a look at his leg. There was no trace of the injury or scar, just a small red blotch.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then gather his spiritual power into his fingers until some blue light began to emit from his fingertips, then, he softly pressed on the blotch.</p>
        <p>As a result, the ointment quickly melted and got absorbed into Wèi WúXiàn’s skin.</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī carried on rubbing the blotch, a warm sensation rose and rapidly spread through the whole limb, gradually acting as an aphrodisiac on Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>He began to move his leg from side to side, up and down, back and forth, in order to escape Lán WàngJī’s massage.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then held Wèi WúXiàn’s calf tight, looked at him, and, in deep voice, he said, “Wèi Yīng, stop waggling your leg.”</p>
        <p>As he was at the same time looking and listening to Lán WàngJī who knelt in front of him, Wèi WúXiàn was stunned by a strong feeling of déjà vu. He at once stopped moving his leg.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī resumed the massage, then, when he finished with the red blotch, he moved on massaging the whole lower leg.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, you become more friendly now.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Really?” he said.</p>
        <p>“Yes, of course.” Wèi WúXiàn said, “You went out of your way to look for my flute. Didn’t you dislike my using the demonic power the most?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī suddenly stopped moving his hands, looked Wèi WúXiàn in the eye, and, in sincere tone, he said, “Wèi Yīng, back then, I was wrong.”</p>
        <p>Dumbfounded, Wèi WúXiàn was thrown off balance.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī carried on, “ A swordplay and a demonic power are both decent methods. It all depends on how the cultivator makes use of them. I should not have tried so blindly to stop you.”</p>
        <p>“You were not wrong.” hurriedly said Wèi WúXiàn, “ What you have said was right. Demonic power can progressively damage your mind and soul. I should not carelessly use it.”</p>
        <p>After a short pause, he resumed, “If I carry on using my demonic power, it will eventually backfire on me.”</p>
        <p>“That will not happen. I will protect you.” vowed Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn blushed at Lán WàngJī’s words. He then quickly changed the topic of their conversation, “How did you find Chénqíng? Zéwú-Jūn said that it was also carried away by the flood.”</p>
        <p>“Chénqíng resonated in response to WàngJī’s spiritual notes.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“Eh?” Wèi WúXiàn was confused. Why would his flute vibrate with the notes of Lán WàngJī’s guqin?</p>
        <p>However, he could not keep on wondering on the subject because Lán WàngJī had resumed massaging his leg.</p>
        <p>Rolling the trouser leg further up, Lán WàngJī massaged Wèi WúXiàn’s leg upward to his thigh.</p>
        <p>Watching Lán WàngJī, it appeared to Wèi WúXiàn that Lán WàngJī was very focused on his task as though it was the most important thing to him.</p>
        <p>Finally, Lán WàngJī was done with the massage. He slightly lifted Wèi WúXiàn’s leg to see if the ointment had been completely absorbed.</p>
        <p>Satisfied, Lán WàngJī put down Wèi WúXiàn’s leg, and unfolded the trouser leg.</p>
        <p>Honestly speaking, Wèi WúXiàn felt that his leg became more numb than it initially was. In addition, he was now in an oblivious state.</p>
        <p>“Do you want to have a closer look at the guqin?” asked Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Still in a daze, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “What did you say?”</p>
        <p>“I said, do you want to see your guqin.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“My guqin? Oh! Yes, I do.” Wèi WúXiàn finally woke up from his stupor. He took support from an adjacent table to stand up, then walked quickly towards the guqin while doing his best not to stumble.</p>
        <p>It was an exquisite seven-string guqin, slightly finer than the usual width of a guqin, and immaculate white like a blanket of snow lay on the top of the mountains.</p>
        <p>Engraved on the body of the guqin, in blue and large characters, was the word ‘WúXiàn’.</p>
        <p>With his name carved on the white guqin, Wèi WúXiàn was now convinced that it was his.</p>
        <p>“May I try it?” he asked.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī nodded, and said, “It belongs to you.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn sat on the low bench reserved for that purpose, and began to play a gentle melody. When he finished, he asked, “How was it?”</p>
        <p>With Lán WàngJī’s eyes of a sea of stars faintly shone golden light, Wèi WúXiàn was once more captivated, being unable to take his eyes off of him.</p>
        <p>With a faint smile, Lán WàngJī replied, “It was perfect.”</p>
        <p>“It did not occur to me that I know how to play guqin.” remarked Wèi WúXiàn, “I learned how to play it when I was twelve years old.”</p>
        <p>“I know.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Is it you who gave it to me?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“It is a very luxurious guqin. It must have cost a fortune.” he remarked.</p>
        <p>“You deserve it.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, you are so awesome now. Since when you become so straightforward?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“I learned it from you.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“What else did you learn from me?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“Not to hold yourself from saying what you have in mind.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“That won’t do.” protested Wèi WúXiàn, “Currently, I am in my teenage years, so you have to behave like the teenager HánGuāng-Jūn that I am used to.”</p>
        <p>“OK.” he agreed.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then asked, “What do I usually do here, at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù? Copying several times the GūsūLán’s rules.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī shook his head in negation, then said, “You go for Night-Hunt*, and, on other occasions, you go out for fun.”</p>
        <small>*Night-Hunt is the usual activity that cultivators do; they suppress evil spirits and demons for the sake of the common people.</small>
        <p>“Going out for fun? Where?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“To many places.” Lán WàngJī replied.</p>
        <p>“For example?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“Currently, there is a place where we can go,” replied Lán WàngJī, “and have a lunch over there. Then, in afternoon, we can take a boat and sightsee the surrounding areas.”</p>
        <p>“Is there something special happening over there?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.</p>
        <p>“There is a Spring Festival.” he replied, “It is a local festival that is held every year in late spring, for ten days, in order to see off the spring.”</p>
        <p>“I’ve never heard of it before.” remarked Wèi WúXiàn, “Is it an event that has started in recent years?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.” he replied, “I’ll take you there, so you can see it for yourself.”</p>
        <p>Already excited, Wèi WúXiàn agreed, “Okay.”</p>

        <p>Lán WàngJī went to the wardrobe and took out two sets of green clothes.</p>
        <p>Surprised, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Do we need to change our clothes?”</p>
        <p>“In that festival, everyone wear green.” Lán WàngJī replied, “We’ve been there before, so we already have the green clothes. ”</p>
        <p>“All right.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Then, he began to take off his clothes. However, halfway through, he felt that something was wrong. He cast a quick look at Lán WàngJī and saw that the latter was watching him. He suddenly felt embarrassed.</p>
        <p>“You can go behind the dressing screen to change your clothes.” suggested Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>With his face turned red, Wèi WúXiàn took his clothes, and quickly went behind the dressing screen.</p>
        <p>Inwardly, he suddenly began to wonder, “This is really weird. We are both males, naturally, there is nothing wrong to be in the same room to change clothes. So, why do I have to be behind the dressing screen?”</p>
        <p>He carried on thinking, “However, if the other person is none other than Lán Zhàn, somehow, it feels different.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then looked through the dressing screen, and saw that Lán WàngJī was facing the dressing screen on the other side. And, it appeared that he had already taken off his outer garments.</p>
        <p>Behind the dressing screen, Lán WàngJī’s silhouette appeared very tall, with broad shoulders and two firm and strong arms. </p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn got a sudden desire to see how Lán WàngJī looked like without his outer robes.</p>
        <p>However, he resisted and carried on changing clothes. And, when he finished, he came out and saw that Lán WàngJī had also finished dressing.</p>
        <p>The garments were very beautiful, and the colour was dark green, similar to a pine tree’s. Wèi WúXiàn had never seen him wearing green clothes before.</p>
        <p>He was so elegant, and, with his natural beauty, he was looking like a deity. Wèi WúXiàn could not help himself from blushing at his gorgeous appearance.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, your cheeks seem slightly red. Are you feeling sick?” asked Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly replied, “I’m feeling fine.” Then, he put a hand on his face, and inwardly said, “Indeed, my face is burning hot.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī turned his head away, and a faint and furtive smile appeared on his face. However, his smile disappeared so quickly that Wèi WúXiàn thought that he saw it wrong.</p>
        <p>“You have wrongly tied your waist-belt.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>He then got closer to Wèi WúXiàn, undid the waist-belt, then properly fastened it around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist, while a faint fragrance of sandalwood caressed Wèi WúXiàn’s nostrils.</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī finished tying his waist-belt, Wèi WúXiàn carefully looked at it, but failed to see any difference from what he had done before.</p>
        <p>However, he became aware of his own appearance; both of them were wearing the identical garments with the same embroidered motifs.</p>
        <p>“Your hair are a little bit messy.” remarked Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn quickly said, “I’ll tidy it myself.” Then, he hurried towards the dressing mirror.</p>
        <p>Upon reaching it, Wèi WúXiàn was shocked by his own reflection in the mirror.</p>
        <p>In a low voice, he said, “Lán Zhàn, Jiāng Chéng said that I once died. So, my current appearance once belonged to the person who summoned me.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī frowned when he heard the word ‘died’ from Wèi WúXiàn’s mouth.</p>
        <p>“This face is indeed different from my formal one.” he said, then turned his head to look at Lán WàngJī, “It seems like I am not the only one here who has changed, you have also changed a lot.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī walked towards Wèi WúXiàn, then stood behind him. They looked at each other in the mirror.</p>
        <p>In a deep voice, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you are still who you used to be, you definitely haven’t changed at all. As for, I haven’t changed either.”</p>
        <p>After a pause, he asked, “Should we go there on our swords?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn hesitantly replied, “Yes.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then fetched a cloak, and said, “Put this on.”</p>
        <p>As was his habit, Wèi WúXiàn just stretched his arms so Lán WàngJī could do it for him. So, he did. Then, he carried on putting the hood over Wèi WúXiàn’s head, and secured it by tying the laces in a knot.</p>
        <p>After a few moments, Wèi WúXiàn suddenly realised that he actually let Lán WàngJī put the cloak on him. Moreover, as they had stepped outside, he unconsciously held Lán WàngJī’s hand to get on Bìchén.</p>
        <p>And, right now, he was standing behind Lán WàngJī, and his eyes were on his broad back. He didn’t know where else to direct his gaze, or where to put his hands.</p>
        <p>“Hold me tight. We will be travelling against the wind.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn said, “In my entire life, I’ve never expected to hear the words ‘Hold me tight’ coming from Lán Zhàn’s mouth.”</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī saw that he hadn’t hold him yet, he took Wèi WúXiàn’s both hands, and made him wrap his arms around his waist.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn just gave up on thinking too much, and firmly held Lán WàngJī’s waist, then, Lán WàngJī set Bìchén in motion; they took off, flying high in the sky.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then began to wonder. “Does Lán Zhàn know that I can no longer, on my own, fly on the sword?”</p>
        <p>Then, he thought again, “Wait a minute! This can’t be the case, because my current body used to belong to someone else, and his spiritual power is not great. That might explain why Lán Zhàn has taken me to drive on his sword.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was lost in thought that he failed to admire the scenery as they flew by.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, what are you thinking about?” asked Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“I’m not thinking.” he denied.</p>
        <p>“We will soon fly across the Green Lake, then arrive in Caiyin Town.” said Lán WàngJī, then, he began to lower their altitude.</p>
        <p>“Is it in that town that the festival is taking place?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” he replied.</p>
        <p>By the time they reached the lake, they were flying at an altitude of few metres above water. At this short distance, they could clearly admire the reflection of the sky gleaming on the surface of the lake, with some thin ripples here and there.</p>
        <p>“Is this the Green Lake?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“Are there water ghouls in this lake?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.</p>
        <p>“No. They have been suppressed.” replied Lán WàngJī, “Two years ago, you have improved the properties of the spiritual nets. This improvement has made the nets be more efficient and convenient underwater, and helped to get rid of the water ghouls.”</p>
        <p>“Wow! I really did that!” he exclaimed.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” replied Lán WàngJī, then, he praised him, which made him feel happy.</p>
        <p>So, Wèi WúXiàn began to talk about the ingenious ideas he had, then carried on narrating his prowess in hunting demons and monsters. Even though Lán WàngJī, from time to time, only replied in monosyllables, he just kept on talking.</p>
        <p>Although he had already heard most of what Wèi WúXiàn was saying, Lán WàngJī just kept on listening. In fact, he never got tired of hearing Wèi WúXiàn speaking.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn gradually hugged Lán WàngJī more and more tighter. When he got tired from talking too much, he put his head against Lán WàngJī’s back, and, progressively, fell asleep.</p>
        <p>Reaching the town of Caiyin, Lán WàngJī drove his sword on the outskirts of the town, found a quiet place, then, he landed.</p>
        <p>He then held Wèi WúXiàn in his arms, and inwardly said, “Indeed, he has fallen asleep.” However, he didn’t want to wake him up.</p>
        <p>He chose a clean and large rock, sat down, and look at Wèi WúXiàn who was soundly sleeping in his arms.</p>
        <p>Only up to now that Lán WàngJī felt a little bit at ease.</p>
        <p>He was in agony for two days of the search, then he had to wait another two days for Wèi WúXiàn to wake up.</p>
        <p>When he finally woke up, Lán WàngJī received a great shock, because Wèi WúXiàn had forgotten all about them living as a couple.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Wèi WúXiàn even said that he wanted to go back to Lotus Piers, when Jiāng Chéng told him that they both had been living and doing everything together.</p>
        <p>Luckily for Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn was still able to read his facial expression, and all his little habits had not changed. So, thankfully, he was still his Wèi Yīng.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī slightly lifted Wèi WúXiàn’s chin, and deeply kissed him.</p>
        <p>Being unconsciously familiar with Lán WàngJī’s touch and scent, Wèi WúXiàn parted his lips, and let Lán WàngJī’s tongue penetrate into his mouth.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī kissed Wèi WúXiàn softly, savouring the sweetness and softness of his tongue. And, at the same, releasing all his anxiety and worries, all his panic and torment of these past four days.</p>
        <p>Then, when he finished kissing him, Lán WàngJī slightly bit Wèi WúXiàn’s lower lip, and the latter let out a “hmm” sound, which set fire down in Lán WàngJī’s manhood.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, you came back a bit earlier. Hurry up, hold me. I am yours.” Wèi WúXiàn once said that to him.</p>
        <p>And, right now, he wanted to make love to him here, at this place, at this instant. He wanted to see his eyes gleaming with lust, and hear him moaning in pleasure. His urge of holding him was way too strong to bear.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī took a deep breath, then, he pecked Wèi WúXiàn on the cheek and lips, and then, he put him on the rock, placed Wèi WúXiàn’s head on his lap, and began to meditate in order to calm himself down.</p>
        <p>After a while, Wèi WúXiàn slowly opened his eyes. While he was sleeping, he had a strange dream. In his dream, Lán WàngJī and he were living in seclusion.</p>
        <p>Both of them were on a boat, and Lán WàngJī, wearing a raincoat, cast a fishing net in the lake.</p>
        <p>On their way back home, they let the current push the boat. Lán WàngJī sat on the bow of the boat, looking at Wèi WúXiàn who was playing some notes on Chénqíng.</p>
        <p>As he finished recalling his dream, Wèi WúXiàn now looked at Lán WàngJī in green garments, and, with the one in a raincoat, in his dream, he saw in front of him the two images of Lán WàngJī overlapping each other.</p>
        <p>He chuckled.</p>
        <p>“What makes you chortle?” Lán WàngJī asked.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn sat up, adjusted his robes, and failed to notice that his head was resting on Lán WàngJī’s lap, he replied, “I was just looking how handsome you are. I also dreamed of you.”</p>
        <p>“Did you sleep well?” he asked.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn noticed that the way Lán WàngJī looked at him was slightly different than before. He got puzzled.</p>
        <p>However, he simply replied, “I slept well.” then he realised, “It’s strange that I easily fell asleep. Didn’t you say that I was in a coma for few days?”</p>
        <p>“You usually don’t wake up so early in the morning.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“Let’s go to the town.” Lán WàngJī carried on, “What do you want to eat?”</p>
        <p>“We’ve already arrived. What is this place?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“This is a village named Cross-Path.” Lán WàngJī replied.</p>
        <p>“What an interesting name.” Wèi WúXiàn remarked.</p>
    </div>

        <p>As they arrive in town, Lán WàngJī chose a fine dining restaurant that served Sichuan cuisine, and asked for an upstairs private room.</p>
        <p>A waiter came over and handed them a menu.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī took the menu and gave it to Wèi WúXiàn, he said, “Order whatever you want to eat.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn looked at the menu, then, to his heart’s content, he ordered, “I’ll have one dish of steamed glutinous rice dumplings, one dish of boiled pak choi, and one dish of bamboo shoot soup.”</p>
        <p>“Let me have a look at the seasonal vegetables.” he carried on, “Add one dish of stir-fried garland chrysanthemum with peas. And, finally, one dish of chicken with bean curd, and two dipping sauces, one spicy and the other non-spicy.”</p>
        <p>He raised his head and noticed Lán WàngJī’s facial expression, he asked, “Why are you looking so happy?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī suppressed a faint smile*, and said to the waiter, “I’ll have one dish of diced fish in chilli sauce, one dish of thinly sliced beef, one dish of diced spicy chicken, and one dish of beef in sour soup.”</p>
        <small>*Lán WàngJī smiles because Wèi WúXiàn mostly orders green dishes (GūsūLán’s usual dishes), while he actually loves spicy food (he is considerate of Lán WàngJī).</small>
        <p>“Will you be able to finish all this?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“I don’t mind if I can’t finish all the dishes.” Lán WàngJī replied, “You can eat them as well.”</p>
        <p>Then, he said to the waiter, “Let the cook know that we would like to have a small portion of every dish.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then gazed at Lán WàngJī’s profile. His awareness of being attracted to him gradually grew. And, the more he spent time with Lán WàngJī, the greater this feeling became.</p>
        <p>After eating, they went for a stroll on the streets.</p>
        <p>Although everyone was wearing green clothes, their appearances were the most outstanding. People were stopping to cast a glance at them.</p>
        <p>As they kept on walking, they soon saw a large group of people queueing in front of a shop.</p>
        <p>Curious, Wèi WúXiàn hurried over there to have a look, and found out that it was a bookshop.</p>
        <p>Then, he returned and asked, “Lán Zhàn, why those people are standing in a queue in front of the bookshop?”</p>
        <p>“Because today is the released day of a popular illustrated book.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“What kind of an illustrated book is so popular?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“Do you want to see it for yourself?” Lán WàngJī asked.</p>
        <p>“Not all.” Wèi WúXiàn replied, “Otherwise, we will have to wait in such a long queue. Let’s go somewhere else instead. Didn’t you plan for us to sightsee on a boat?”</p>
        <p>“There’s no need for queueing.” replied Lán WàngJī, “I have priorly placed an order.”</p>
        <p>Then, he led Wèi WúXiàn all the way to the front door of the bookshop, and showed a red card to the shop assistant.</p>
        <p>The red card attracted attention of many people in the queue. And Wèi WúXiàn could see in their eyes a burning jealousy.</p>
        <p>After examining the card, the shop assistant told Lán WàngJī to wait for a moment, then he entered the shop.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then cast a look inside the shop, and saw many bookshelves densely filled with books. And, it seemed that all those books were of the same kind.</p>
        <p>He also noticed that the staff were busy from picking up books from the selves and packing them.</p>
        <p>While he was impatiently waiting, Wèi WúXiàn overheard a conversation of people next to him.</p>
        <p>“Really? Here I was thinking that he has turned over a new leaf.” said one of them.</p>
        <p>“How can he change? People don’t change their way so easily.” said second person.</p>
        <p>“Yílíng Lǎozǔ has done so many evil deeds. How can you believe that he has changed?” said the third.</p>
        <p>“He has even influenced HánGuāng-Jūn, this is just unbelievable.”</p>
        <p>“What are you guys talking about? What did Yílíng Lǎozǔ do this time?”</p>
        <p>“Have you not heard the rumour that is circulating around?”</p>
        <p>“A few days ago, in the upper reaches of Han River, it had rained just a little bit. However, Yílíng Lǎozǔ mobilised a large troop, and forced the villagers from Wěishàn to leave their village.</p>
        <p>“Then, he blew the village’s dam, inundating the entire village in order to diverge the flood of Han River.</p>
        <p>“Fortunately, the villagers had run away quickly, otherwise, they would have been drowned because of his actions.”</p>
        <p>“I heard that many people had died.”</p>
        <p>“Regardless of whether people had died or not, he had definitely flooded their ancestral graveyard. He either uses people’s graveyards to summon corpses, or floods them. Why he always has to destroyed other people’s ancestral graveyards.”</p>
        <p>“Still, HánGuāng-Jūn does not do anything about it.”</p>
        <p>“Don’t you know that people are the product of their environment. Since he has spent so many years with Yílíng Lǎozǔ, he also becomes like him. I’m afraid that HánGuāng-Jūn is just a self-righteous person.</p>
        <p>“And GūsūLán sect just yearns to possess the devices that Yílíng Lǎozǔ invents from time to time.”</p>
        <p>“I heard that it was HánGuāng-Jūn who destroyed the dam. So, he is also to be blamed for the killing of those people.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn clenched his fists, while, inwardly saying, “I thought that my heart was as hard as a rock, that nothing will shake me up. I was wrong.”</p>
        <p>Then, once again, Jiāng Chéng’s account began to echo inside his head, “Lán WàngJī and you become inseparable. Lán WàngJī protects you because people still hate you.”</p>
        <p>“If the rumour was only about me,” said Wèi WúXiàn inwardly, “I would not care in the slightest. However, I can’t tolerate the fact that Lán Zhàn has been bad-mouthed, as well.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn didn’t know how to face his uncertain future, or why was he still by Lán WàngJī’s side?</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng.” Lán WàngJī’s voice sounded to his ears as if it came from a far distance, like in a dream.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn turned his head and noted that Lán WàngJī was looking at him with all the kindness he had.</p>
        <p>“Let’s go” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Then, he held Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, and led him away from the bookshop.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then gently freed his hand from Lán WàngJī’s.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, don’t mind what they said, because it’s not the truth.” he said.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn let out a dispirited “uh-huh” sound. His devastated mood and racing thoughts remained unchanged until they got on the boat.</p>
        <p>There was one crucial question that he had opted to suppress so far. However, right now, he could no longer prevent it from emerging.</p>
        <p>Why people still hated him despite the issue of the last survivors of the Wēn clan had been settled, and despite he had already destroyed the Tiger Talisman?</p>
        <p>His decision to protect those people from the last branch of the Wēn clan would never be understood by others. His ruthless methods used during Shooting Star campaign would always stay in their memories. How could he be accepted by them?</p>
        <p>And, why was he staying with Lán WàngJī?</p>
        <p>Was there no place for him in this vast world?</p>
        <p>In a gentle voice, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you haven’t harmed anyone in that village. The relocation has already been settled between the villagers and the authorities---”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn interrupted Lán WàngJī, “Lán Zhàn, I know what kind of person I am, and what I won’t never do.”</p>
        <p>With a derisive smile, he carried on, “It’s just that other people don’t think that way.”</p>
        <p>“You never care about what others think.” remarked Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“But I care about what you think.” he unconsciously uttered those words.</p>
        <p>They were both, at once, surprised by what he just said; Lán WàngJī was surprise because Wèi WúXiàn had completely forgotten how they cared for each other, while Wèi WúXiàn didn’t understand why he said those words.</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī laughed; this was a very rare occasion to see him laughing, that Wèi WúXiàn was absolutely amazed, and his heart began to beat rapidly.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you once said ‘What is right or wrong is decided by oneself. One’s reputation is judged by others.’ So, you don’t care about the rest. So, neither I.”</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, you laughed.” said Wèi WúXiàn while laughing as well.</p>
        <p>“You, too.” he replied.</p>
        <p>The swaying movement of the boat gradually swept away Wèi WúXiàn’s melancholic thoughts.</p>
        <p>“I have ordered from the bookshop a collection of books that you wanted to have. Do you want to read them?” asked Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” he replied.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then took out from his sleeve a set of books fastened with a red string.</p>
        <p>On the cover, there was a picture of an one-eyed young man clad in red, wearing black boots and a sword on his waist, and a young Taoist in white robes, with a rain hat hanging on his back.</p>
        <p>“A King Demon And A Taoist.” read Wèi WúXiàn while undoing the red string, “By the title of this book, it is indeed something that I would like to read.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, of course.” remarked Lán WàngJī, “You have already read the previous volumes.”</p>
        <p>There were four volumes in total, and Wèi WúXiàn took the first follow-up volume, read the first few pages, then said, “Yes, indeed. Somehow, the story seems familiar to me.”</p>
        <p>“You usually read in your spare time.” Lán WàngJī said.</p>
        <p>Then, he placed a plate of roasted melon seeds and a plate of fresh fruit close to Wèi WúXiàn, and then, he began to make some tea, while thinking that if the story had left a vague impression on Wèi WúXiàn, maybe it was because he had read it so many times before.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn finished reading the first book, and was convinced that he knew not only the plot but also the characters of the story.</p>
        <p>After carefully reading the whole second book, he felt somehow a resemblance to a character of the story, and yet, there were also some differences between the character and him. And, he had an intuition on the fate of the character.</p>
        <p>He then quickly read the third book. Upon finishing it, his hand was already on the last one, stroking its cover. However, he did not dare to open it.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn!” he called out.</p>
        <p>“I’m right here.” said Lán WàngJī while serving him another cup of tea.</p>
        <p>“Does this story has a happy ending?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“Yes, I think so.” he replied, “The author of these books never writes tragic ending stories.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then felt relieved, and opened the last volume.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī summoned WàngJī, then, he began gently to strum on the guqin, playing a serene melody.</p>
        <p>After a while, Wèi WúXiàn finished and closed the book. He was very excited, and, once more, he began to wonder, “In the story, the character’s situation has some similarities with my own. We both, no doubt, have also a similar personality.”</p>
        <p>He carried on, “A warrior is always by himself, walking his path alone. Luckily, the character in the story has someone, who never leaves his side.</p>
        <p>“This kind of bond between two people is so heart-warming, making one feel envious of their relationship.</p>
        <p>“If Lán Zhàn and I could also be like this...”</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <p>After having such wish in his mind, Wèi WúXiàn could not help but cast a furtive look in Lán WàngJī’s direction.</p>
        <p>At that precise moment, Lán WàngJī also looked at him, and his look seemed to asked Wèi WúXiàn if he had finished reading the books.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn suppressed his thought, then asked, “Lán Zhàn, is there another set of the volumes coming up?”</p>
        <p>“There is no more follow-up, because the story is finished.” replied Lán WàngJī, “Other volumes are in Jìngshì. The set of books that you just finished reading is the final one.”</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, you seem to know everything about this story.” he remarked.</p>
        <p>“Because we also have a full version of the story that was previously published without illustration. So, I have read that version with you.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Really?” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, while trying to control his heartbeat that had suddenly quickened, “Then, tell me which passage of the story I like the most.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī put aside WàngJī, walked and stood behind Wèi WúXiàn, leaned over him, and then, he opened the third book on a chapter named ‘Sailing In The Sea Of Ghosts’.</p>
        <p>His voice was low and clear, echoing in Wèi WúXiàn’s ears, “Wèi Yīng, as far as I am concerned, you are my infinite view. Even when I am in peril, you always stay by my side. What is important in my eyes is you, not who are you.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn began to wonder, “It seems to me that I have heard Lán Zhàn’s voice uttering these very same words before.”</p>
        <p>Then, he could no longer controlled his heartbeat, since his heart was now pounding as though it was about to burst out of his chest.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī called out, “Wèi Yīng.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn turned his head towards Lán WàngJī, who was still leaning over him, and, immediately, he felt as if he was swallowed by his golden eyes flickering like a sea of starts. Moreover, it seemed like he had some difficulty in breathing properly.</p>
        <p>“What?” he managed to ask.</p>
        <p>“This is your most favourite passage of the story.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“My what? Oh!” he then collected himself, “Yes, I like this passage the most, it’s my favourite.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn forced himself to calm down in order to conceal his palpitating heart from Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>He then asked, “What happened afterwards?”</p>
        <p>“Afterwards, they became a couple, and lived together for the rest of their lives.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“They became a couple?” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Yes, they became a couple.” Lán WàngJī replied, “You don’t like it?”</p>
        <p>“Come again?” he said.</p>
        <p>“Does it displease you, the fact that two men became couple?” Lán WàngJī repeated the question.</p>
        <p>“Why should I be displeased?” he replied, “As long as two people like each other, their gender does not matter at all.”</p>
        <p>“Uh-huh.” agreed Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Who exactly is Bai WuXiang?” asked Wèi WúXiàn, “Has he been defeated in the end?”</p>
        <p>“You never like me to spoil the plot.” he replied, “Wait until we return in Jìngshì, so you can read it for yourself.”</p>
        <p>“All right, then. I’ll read it when we get back home.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Soon after, however, he asked yet another question, “Are they both safe and sound?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī wore a concerned expression, he replied, “After defeating Bai WuXiang, the main character’s magical power was exhausted, which caused his body to become transparent.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was chocked.</p>
        <p>“The character says to his partner:” said Lán WàngJī while sitting in front of Wèi WúXiàn and looking straight into his eyes, “I know everything about you; your bravery, your despair, your kindness, your pain, your grievance, your abhorrence, your cleverness and your foolishness.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī spoke very slow, however, Wèi WúXiàn’s heart was beating fast. Here we go again with the uncontrollable heartbeat.</p>
        <p>“He knows everything about me?” wondered Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Like the characters in the story,” he carried on, “I feel that I was completely defeated, a perfect failure covered with blood, rebuked and criticised by others, being extremely desperate and having no other choice but to cry.</p>
        <p>“However, Lán Zhàn has the memories of these past twenty years. So, he knows everything that happened during these years, including everything about me.</p>
        <p>“Had I once been in an unpleasant situation in which it was difficult to escape? In his eyes, how does Lán Zhàn see me?”</p>
        <p>Then, all of a sudden, he asked, “Lán Zhàn, what do you know about me?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī was dumbfounded, he did not expect Wèi WúXiàn to ask him this question.</p>
        <p>However, since the question had been asked, Lán WàngJī didn’t have other option but to give an answer. And, since Lán WàngJī had always kept something that was very painful for him, and very concerned about it, he could no longer keep it hidden deep down in his heart.</p>
        <p>“I know that you gave away your golden core to Jiāng WǎnYín*.” he replied, “Wèi Yīng, was it painful when your golden core had been cut off?”</p>
        <small>*Jiāng WǎnYín is Jiāng Chéng’s given name.</small>
        <p>After asking this question, Lán WàngJī immediately regretted it, because he didn’t want to bring this awful memory to Wèi WúXiàn’s mind.</p>
        <p>This time it was Wèi WúXiàn’s turn to be dumbfounded. He was in fact worried that he would learn something unbearable about himself. However, he did not expect that Lán WàngJī would be worried about his pain during the surgery.</p>
        <p>He quickly collected himself, “You also know about that.” he calmly said, “ It didn’t hurt at all. I believe you have heard of Wēn Qíng*, the divine physician. She had made a very powerful anaesthetic.”</p>
        <smal>*Wēn Qíng is the leader of the last branch of Wēn clan.</smal>
        <p>Lán WàngJī somehow expected this kind of answer. He abruptly stood up and went to stand by the window, facing outside while he remained silent. He didn’t want to let Wèi WúXiàn notice that he was upset.</p>
        <p>“He said that it hadn’t hurt at all.” said Lán WàngJī inwardly, “While, in fact, it had hurt a lot. Even after all these years, he still doesn’t want to talk about it openly.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn felt uneasy as he noted that Lán WàngJī’s expression had changed. He walked up to him, and stood by his side.</p>
        <p>With a timid smile, he said, “Lán Zhàn, you haven’t finished telling what happened to the characters in the story. You said that the main character’s body became transparent. Did he still live together with his partner?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī pulled himself together, then turned his head towards Wèi WúXiàn, while his eyes reflecting the outside scenery of the beautiful lake and mountains.</p>
        <p>Back then, as a teenager, he had deeply fallen in love with him, and, ever since Wèi WúXiàn had become his obsession.</p>
        <p>Looking into his eyes, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, although all good things must come to an end, I will never be parted from you.”</p>
        <p>“`Huh?” Wèi WúXiàn was puzzled.</p>
        <p>“The main character only departed for one year, and, afterwards, he returned to his partner’s side, because, before his departure, he said and swore to him: ‘Enjoyable experiences cannot last for ever, however, I will never be parted from you.’.” said Lán WàngJī while still looking at Wèi WúXiàn with his charming eyes.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn felt as though Lán WàngJī was saying those words to him.</p>
        <p>Then, like a flashback, it seemed to him that he was in Jìngshì under the warm light of a candle, and Lán WàngJī was reading this passage for you.</p>
        <p>“This is really going to kill me.” said Wèi WúXiàn inwardly.</p>
        <p>He could no longer resist, and, slowly, he moved closer and closer to Lán WàngJī, so close that he could see his own reflection in his golden eyes.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the boat shook violently, and Wèi WúXiàn lost his balance, and when he was about to fall backwards, Lán WàngJī caught him in the nick of time.</p>
        <p>Outside of the cabin, they could hear the boatman shouting and cursing. Apparently, another boat accidentally bumped into theirs.</p>
        <p>After he was done shouting to his counterpart, the boatman got closer to the cabin, and apologised to them.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī opened the curtain and went outside. He seemed to have said to the boatman: “It doesn’t matter.” However, the sound of the water covered the rest of their conversation.</p>
        <p>“Just now, was I about to kiss Lán Zhàn?” Wèi WúXiàn was in state of panic.</p>
        <p>Soon after, Wèi WúXiàn remembered the strict curfew of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, and, not wanting Lán WàngJī to break the rules of his sect, he suggested that they should end their sightseeing and go back home.</p>
        <p>On their way home, they saw a young girl selling flowers. On the petals of those vivid and colourful flowers, there were some tiny droplets of water, which enhanced flowers’ natural colours.</p>
        <p>Moreover, one could smell a delicate fragrance coming from the basket that contained the flowers.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn picked up some magnolia and acacia flowers, then he raised Lán WàngJī’s hand so to take out the purse from his sleeve. His way of doing so was so natural that one could see that it was not the first time that he performed this action.</p>
        <p>Having the purse in his hand, Wèi WúXiàn then released that he had done something inappropriate. He blushed with embarrassment, and returned the purse in Lán WàngJī’s sleeve.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then took out the purse, and handed it to him, he said, “You can have it.”</p>
        <p>At once, any trace of bashfulness disappeared from Wèi WúXiàn’s face, he paid for the flowers, then tied them into a bouquet.</p>
        <p>The mix of the white magnolia with the red acacia was attractively pleasing to the eye.</p>
        <p>“It’s for you.” Wèi WúXiàn gave the bouquet to Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī took the bouquet, and, in a deep voice, he said, “Thanks.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn no longer bothered himself wondering why Lán WàngJī had changed to the point that he would easily accept something from him.</p>
        <p>Deep down, he was in fact delighted that Lán WàngJī accepted the bouquet. As a result of being in a good mood, his way of walking became more lively.</p>
        <p>He began to toss up Lán WàngJī’s purse into the air, while noting that the pale blue purse was kept with great care.</p>
        <p>He also noticed that the purse was made with a high quality fabric, as well as was the white silk yarn used for the embroidery. However, the embroidered shape was curled into a white ball; it was hard to tell what it was.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, what does this embroidered shape represent?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“It is a curl cloud.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was agape, however, he praised the work despite himself, “It’s very unique, it has some feature and style. The person who made this purse has some skills.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī made no comment, he just smiled*.</p>
        <small>*Apparently, it’s Wèi WúXiàn himself who makes the purse.</small>

        <p>Before getting on Bìchén, Lán WàngJī put the cloak on Wèi WúXiàn, and the latter, no longer wanting to bother with this matter, just took it as a normal act from Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>On their way to the town, they had travelled against the headwind, however, on their way back, it was a tailwind.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī let Wèi WúXiàn stand in front, and, in a natural way, he wrapped his arms around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist, initiating him to lean against his torso.</p>
        <p>The exotic, sweet and warm scent of sandalwood coming from Lán WàngJī also encircled Wèi WúXiàn, and the latter began to hear the sound of his own heartbeat quickened.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then began to move his hands aimlessly. However, when his hands were about to touch Lán WàngJī, he quickly retracted them.</p>
        <p>He wanted to touch him, but he didn’t dare to do so.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was aware that Lán WàngJī valued him, treating him very kindly. However, he didn’t want to speculate on how much his ‘esteem’ was, and whether his way of ‘treating him’ was what he was thinking of.</p>
        <p>Never before had he experienced such unsettled feeling, he didn’t know what to do, he feared that it was just his own fantasy, that he was overly confident.</p>
        <p>“Shall I touch his hand?” wondered Wèi WúXiàn, “If Lán Zhàn avoids my touching him, I will just feign ignorance.” after a pause, he resumed, “Somehow, I feel that Lán Zhàn won’t dodge my touch.”</p>
        <p>“Throughout the entire day, Lán Zhàn himself has been touching me.” he carried on, “Hold on! It sounds a little bit weird to use the word ‘touching’ when it comes to Lán Zhàn.”</p>
        <p>In the morning, Lán WàngJī carried him on his back until they reached Jìngshì, then he massaged his leg, he adjusted his waist belt, and he even held his hand and took him away from the bookshop.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn recalled every single action, expression and word of Lán WàngJī, then he resolved to touch him by pretending that it was an accident.</p>
        <p>Determined as he was, Wèi WúXiàn began to moved his hand bit by bit towards Lán WàngJī’s hand.</p>
        <p>It seemed to him as though the wind had stopped blowing, that he had held his own breath.</p>
        <p>Then, his fingers slightly touched Lán WàngJī’s hand. However, he also brushed something hard, and, at once, his curiosity took over his anxiety, he held and raised Lán WàngJī’s hand so to have a look.</p>
        <p>It was a beautiful white bracelet, which reflecting some light on its surface.</p>
        <p>“I’ve never seen you wearing a bracelet before.” he remarked.</p>
        <p>In a soft tone, Lán WàngJī said, “It’s you who gave it to me.”</p>
        <p>Overjoyed, Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “I gave it to you? That’s pretty cool! It seems that I’m not staying in GūsūLán sect as a freeloader, after all.”</p>
        <p>There was something else on Lán WàngJī’s wrist; a knotted hair, and Wèi WúXiàn could straight way tell that there was two different hair: Lán WàngJī’s and his.</p>
        <p>He said, “Hair?” deliberately avoid to say knotted hair.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” Lán WàngJī replied, “The hair is a mix of yours and mine.” Lán WàngJī also avoid to say knotted hair* because he didn’t want to shock Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <small>*During the traditional Chinese wedding, the newlyweds cut off a lock of their hair, then tie it into a knot. In other words, Wèi WúXiàn gives Lán WàngJī his knotted hair as a token of their union.</small>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then pondered, “Why the stuff I gave Lán Zhàn are somewhat ambiguous?! Could it be that my own self in these past years likes Lán Zhàn as well?”</p>
        <p>He carried on, “That could be plausible, because Lán Zhàn is kind, as well as handsome, so it is hard not to like him.”</p>
        <p>He turned his head so to look at Lán WàngJī. “Indeed, Lán Zhàn is very handsome,” he said inwardly, “his eyebrows, his eyes, his nose and his lips are really beautiful. He is without a doubt the most good-looking man I’ve ever seen.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then noticed that Lán WàngJī had already put back the hand, which he was holding, on his waist. This time, however, Lán WàngJī took along Wèi WúXiàn’s hands, and wrapped them with his own hands.</p>
        <p>The feeling of being loved enveloped his whole body, making Wèi WúXiàn feel fully content and free to fly, like a bird, higher and higher.</p>
        <br />
        <p>--- --- ---</p>
        <br />
        <p>Back in Jìngshì, Lán WàngJī prepared all the necessities for a bath.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, this wooden bathtub is huge,” remarked Wèi WúXiàn while his fingers slightly tapping on the brim of the bathtub, “it’s large enough for two people to bathe in, for sure.”</p>
        <p>Then, “Good heavens! What did I just say?” he exclaimed inwardly, “That was careless of me to say those words. And, what Lán Zhàn is going to think of it?”</p>
        <p>However, Lán WàngJī remained silent.</p>
        <p>With his back facing Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn could not see his expression, nor did he dare to turn around and look at him.</p>
        <p>He nervously gulped, and said, “Lán Zhàn, go ahead.”</p>
        <p>“Do you want me to bathe before you?” Lán WàngJī calmly asked.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn quickly replied, “Yes, go ahead. I’ll go and wait outside.” Then, he dashed out of the room.</p>
        <p>Once outside, he began to release the tension he had felt, “Lán Zhàn’s tone was soft, but, at the same, it sounded frightening, it really scared me.”</p>
        <p>Soon after, as he finished bathing, Lán WàngJī came out, wearing not the dressing gown, but, unexpectedly, the elegant attire of his sect, as well as the forehead ribbon.</p>
        <p>Regardless of whatever Lán WàngJī wore, he was as usual looking graceful.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, I’m done.” said Lán WàngJī, “ It’s your turn to take a bath.”</p>
        <p>Without further ado, Wèi WúXiàn enter the room, removed his clothes and got into the wooden bathtub. </p>
        <p>He sank in the bathtub until water covered his mouth, then, he started, like a kid, to produce bubbles.</p>
        <p>“If my guess is correct,” he began to think, “that would mean that Lán Zhàn and I are intimately close.</p>
        <p>“However, if I’m wrong, that would be really embarrassing. I would not have the face to look at Lán Zhàn. And, also, Lán Zhàn might feel unease being with me.”</p>
        <p>He carried on, “I should think it over, once more, shouldn’t I? No. I should calm myself down, I need to calm down, I have to pull myself together.”</p>
        <p>However, by the time he finished bathing, his mind was still in turmoil.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn immediately noticed that he wasn’t as neatly dressed as Lán WàngJī. He had just put on the clean clothes that Lán WàngJī had prepared for him, then, he had thrown on the dark green robe that he was wearing earlier.</p>
        <p>“Oh!” he then released that the green robe was actually the one Lán WàngJī was wearing, and he became extremely embarrassed, he thought “This is an inexcusable act!”</p>
        <p>Then, he saw that Lán WàngJī was coming towards him, and each of his steps made his heart beat more rapidly.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī, however, didn’t stop but went past Wèi WúXiàn. The latter then let out a sigh of relief, however, he also somehow felt disappointed.</p>
        <p>As he turned around in Lán WàngJī’s direction, the first thing Wèi WúXiàn saw was a large white bath towel that landed on his head.</p>
        <p>“Your hair is still wet.” said Lán WàngJī, then, he began to wipe Wèi WúXiàn ’s hair. Starting from the scalp, he softly massaged Wèi WúXiàn ’s head, then carried on bit by bit rubbing the whole hair.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn felt as though he was float on a cloud, feeling relaxed and peaceful, and everything around him became silent, excepted the rustle of his hair being wiped.</p>
        <p>As he finished wiping Wèi WúXiàn’s hair, Lán WàngJī went to put the bath towel on the dressing screen, then, he walked back. Using his spiritual power, Lán WàngJī began to run his fingers through Wèi WúXiàn’s long hair so to dry them up.</p>
        <p>“Why did he use the bath towel if he could dry my hair with his spiritual power?” Wèi WúXiàn was still pondering on the matter when Lán WàngJī’s voice interrupted his thoughts.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, where do you want to sleep?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“This indeed is a good question.” thought Wèi WúXiàn, then, he raised his head to look at Lán WàngJī, and read a lustful look on his handsome face, a look that set fire on his whole body.</p>
        <p>In a languid voice, Wèi WúXiàn managed to ask, “Lán Zhàn, where do you usually sleep?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī didn’t say anything, he just pointed his finger towards a door leading to another room.</p>
        <p>“All right, then. Goodnight.” said Wèi WúXiàn, and quickly went to the bed in which he woke up this morning, while repeating to himself ‘Calm yourself down’, like chanting an incantation.</p>
        <p>Lying alone on the bed, and without removing his forehead ribbon, Lán WàngJī occupied his mind with the rules of his sect in order to cool himself down.</p>
        <p>He didn’t want to rush Wèi WúXiàn, he was prepared to wait until his Wèi Yīng got ready to accept him. And, this time, Lán WàngJī wanted him to experience things far better than before.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then turned over to one side, then, the very next instance, he turned over to the other side, then, finally, he turned to face the ceiling, unable to find some sleep.</p>
        <p>Through the window, the moonlight shone brightly into the room, like the night his Wèi Yīng had returned, reminiscing Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>He then began to meditate so to soothe the pain felt from his swollen manhood.</p>
        <p>Some time had elapsed before Lán WàngJī began to hear some faint noises.</p>
        <p>In the main room, also unable to sleep, Wèi WúXiàn was pacing back and forth, he inwardly said, “I want to see Lán Zhàn’s sleeping face, I’ll just take a furtive quick look.”</p>
        <p>Having made up his mind, Wèi WúXiàn quietly enter the room, and, to his surprise, Lán WàngJī was not sleeping, but rather fixing his eyes on him intensively.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn nervously said, “Lán Zhàn, I’m thirsty.”</p>
        <p>“Thirsty?” Lán WàngJī’s voice was low and hoarse, “The pot of water is on the table.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then turned around, and, from where he was standing he could see the table of the main room, yes, indeed, there was a clay pot on the table.</p>
        <p>From his own bed, Wèi WúXiàn was only few metres away from the table. It was then obvious that he did not get up to drink water.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī walked to the table, poured water on a cup, warmed up the cup with his spiritual power, then, he turned to look at Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>His intense and fiery gaze made Wèi WúXiàn’s legs wobble. For a while, both of them looked at each other.</p>
        <p>Then, still holding the cup of warm water, Lán WàngJī walked up to him, then put directly the cup to Wèi WúXiàn’s lips as to help him drink.</p>
        <p>Out of force of habit, Wèi WúXiàn held the hand that carried the cup to his lips, then, he took two gulps of water.</p>
        <p>All of a sudden, he paused, and the time seemed to have stopped.</p>
        <p>“Something is not quite right!” Wèi WúXiàn was puzzled, “How could I just drink up from Lán Zhàn’s hand? What is even more wrong is the fact that Lán Zhàn himself initiates me to do so.”</p>
        <p>With the rim of the cup still pressed on his lips, Wèi WúXiàn looked up at Lán WàngJī, and was at once sucked into his burning gaze.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, the air around him became dense, and, within himself, something was furtively warming up.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Lán WàngJī seemed to gulp involuntarily. “Are you done drinking?” he asked.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then let go of Lán WàngJī’s hand, as well as removing his lips away from the cup, then, he nodded.</p>
        <p>On his lower lip, some tiny droplets of water were softly sparkling, which made the delicate red lips become more sensual.</p>
        <p>At the sight of these inviting lips, Lán WàngJī unconsciously clenched his free hand into a fist, he said, “All right.” then walked to the table to put back the cup.</p>
        <p>For a short while, none of them spoke, then, suddenly, Lán WàngJī, who was still standing by the table, walked back to Wèi WúXiàn and hugged him.</p>
        <p>As one would expect, Wèi WúXiàn did not push him away, or struggle to set free, he just let Lán WàngJī embrace him.</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī carried Wèi WúXiàn in his arms, went to the bed, and laid him down.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then sat up and looked at Lán WàngJī, who was standing by the bed, tall and silent. Light from the candle cast a shadow on his face, so Wèi WúXiàn was unable see his expression.</p>
        <p>His breathing quickened, then, after a short while, Wèi WúXiàn shifted so to make room in the bed, quietly inviting Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī slowly sat down on the bed, then, in a hoarse voice, he asked, “You can’t sleep?”</p>
        <p>“I can’t find sleep.” he replied, “Lull me to sleep.”</p>
        <p>With his slender fingers, Lán WàngJī stroked Wèi WúXiàn’s fringe, then gently tucked it behind the ear. He looked into his eyes, and began to humming a gentle and serene tune, the same tune that Wèi WúXiàn played in the morning.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn began to stare at Lán WàngJī vacantly, while his mind was gradually wandering away. Then, after a while, he dreamily uttered, ‘WàngXiàn’.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī abruptly stopped humming, his eyes widened in surprise.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, isn’t ‘WàngXiàn’ the name of the tune that you just hummed? ” he asked.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī’s breathing became so heavy that one could clearly see the up and down movements of his chest, he replied, “Yes.”</p>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn began to ask a series of questions.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, didn’t you give me the white guqin as a gift?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“Yes, I did.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“Didn’t I give you the white bracelet that you wore today?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Yes, you did.” Lán WàngJī replied.</p>
        <p>“Do we always travel together and wear identical clothes, and read the same novels in which you know which passages are my favourite?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“Yes, that’s correct.” he replied.</p>
        <p>This time, however, before asking his question, Wèi WúXiàn nervously clenched his fists, then, he took a deep breath, “Lán Zhàn, what kind of relationship do we have?”</p>
        <p>“What do you think?” Lán WàngJī replied, then, he sighed, “Wèi Yīng, what kind of relationship do you wish us to have?”</p>
        <p>As he spoke, the warm yellow light of the candle showered on his eyelashes. Lán WàngJī intensively fixed his lustful eyes on Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>With this beautiful face, having this sensual expression with this burning gaze, in addition, in this suggestive atmosphere, Wèi WúXiàn seemed to have lost reason, his whole body began to ignite.</p>
        <p>Then, impulsively, he moved forward and kissed Lán WàngJī so passionately that he hit his lower lip against Lán WàngJī’s teeth.</p>
        <p>The slight pain felt from his lip brought back his sense, he hastily retreated, and quickly began to say, “This is not...”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī pulled him in his arms, then, feverishly, he began to kiss him. Lán WàngJī’s tongue went deep into his mouth, sweeping every area of it, then, he entwined his own tongue with his, bringing out Wèi WúXiàn’s tongue, and sucking it with all passion he had.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn let out an ‘aah’ sound, which caused Lán WàngJī to pause. Then, he resumed shortly after, however, this time, his kisses became more gentle.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī untied Wèi WúXiàn’s hair ribbon, then, slowly, he ran his fingers through his long hair, and then, he gently slid his fingers behind Wèi WúXiàn’s neck, then carried on caressing his back, progressively moving down and stroking Wèi WúXiàn’s slender waist.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, his tongue still explored Wèi WúXiàn’s mouth, softly intertwined their both tongues.</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī began to tease Wèi WúXiàn, he slowly ran the tip of his tongue on Wèi WúXiàn’s soft and sensitive lips, tracing the edges of the lips.</p>
        <p>Then, at his leisure, he gave Wèi WúXiàn a series of soft kisses on the forehead, on the eyelids, on the cheeks, on the top and lower lips, as well as on the corners of the lips, then, he gently began to suck Wèi WúXiàn’s lips.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn began to feel woozy from Lán WàngJī’s kisses, his whole body became hot.</p>
        <p>After a while, Lán WàngJī released him, then, in a deep voice, he asked, “Wèi Yīng, did you dislike it?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn looked at him with a dazed expression on his face, he absent-mindedly asked “What?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī kissed him again, then, he asked, “You don’t like it, when I kiss you?”</p>
        <p>“How could I possible dislike it?” replied Wèi WúXiàn, “It should be me, who should ask this question?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī smiled, then kissed him softly, and then, he confessed, “Wèi Yīng, in Baifeng Mountain*, it’s was me, who kissed you.”</p>
        <small>*Baifeng Mountain is the place where Lán WàngJī steals Wèi WúXiàn’s first kiss, furtively.</small>
        <p>“What?” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, extremely surprised, this revelation sobered him up.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī, however, did not let him remain sober, as he began to kiss him again, and, this time, his kisses were vigorous, impatient and fiery.</p>
        <p>He hugged Wèi WúXiàn tight, his lips devoured his, then, he slid his tongue into his mouth, and entangled it with Wèi WúXiàn’s tongue.</p>
        <p>After playing with his tongue, Lán WàngJī returned to Wèi WúXiàn’s lips, and began to kiss and suck them until they became numb, and until Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body began to beg for more.</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī slid his hands through Wèi WúXiàn’s sleeves, the palms of his hands were comfortably warm that they made Wèi WúXiàn become more inviting.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, compared to when Lán WàngJī caressed him through his nightclothes, the feeling of his hands directly stroking every inch of his bare back made Wèi WúXiàn feel more and more horny, he was trembling with pleasure.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī moved one hand down to Wèi WúXiàn’s hips, and slid it through the underwear, and then, gently, he began to stroke his hips, while his other hand carried on caressing Wèi WúXiàn’s back.</p>
        <p>As he realised that he became hard, Wèi WúXiàn felt ashamed, and, in order to avoid Lán WàngJī to notice it, he put his hands against Lán WàngJī’s chest, and moved back.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī didn’t want to force him, he just let go of him, and then, they looked at each other, both were out of breath from their kisses and burning desire for each other.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī looked like someone who had reached his limit, the desire shown through his eyes was way too strong, that there was no word to describe it, and Wèi WúXiàn had not seen to that extent Lán WàngJī’s eyes looked.</p>
        <p>Controlling his desire, Lán WàngJī put his hand on Wèi WúXiàn’s shoulder, and the latter could not help but tremble a little bit.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī paused, and then, he began to adjust Wèi WúXiàn’s nightclothes, and, accidentally, his fingers brushed his neck, and Wèi WúXiàn moaned, which stirred Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>With great effort, Lán WàngJī got a hold of himself, and, slowly, he began to withdraw his hand, however, Wèi WúXiàn caught Lán WàngJī’s hand, and the latter looked at him with a questioning expression on his face.</p>
        <p>And then, he said out loud his most desire, “Wèi Yīng, I want you.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn slowly nodded in agreement, and Lán WàngJī, without losing any moment, began to untie the top of Wèi WúXiàn’s his nightclothes.</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī undressed him, it seemed to Wèi WúXiàn that everything were running in a slow motion, namely, the time taken for his top to slide off of his shoulders, the time Lán WàngJī took to hold his arms and peel off the sleeves, as well as removing completely his nightclothes.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng?”, Lán WàngJī’s eyes seemed to ask Wèi WúXiàn if he was ready to receive him, which made Wèi WúXiàn extremely embarrassed that he felt like covering his naked body.</p>
        <p>“I... I am a little bit skinny now.” Then, he remembered that this current body was not his origin one.</p>
        <p>Earlier, when he was taking a bath, he was so preoccupied by the nature of their relationship that it didn’t cross his mind to have a look at his new body.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī thought that he was comparing his current body to his former one, he said, “Wèi Yīng, you look handsome, and your body is really attractive.”</p>
        <p>Then, he began to caress Wèi WúXiàn’s neck, then his shoulders, and then his chest, pinching and twisting slightly his nipples.</p>
        <p>“Aah” Wèi WúXiàn gave a moan of pleasure.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, in order to keep you satisfied, I learned how to cook.”whispered Lán WàngJī to his ear, “I’ll cook whatever you want me to cook for you.”</p>
        <p>“Uh-huh.” agreed Wèi WúXiàn, and, somehow, he seemed not surprised to learn that Lán WàngJī could cook.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then carried on stroking his whole upper body, slowly and gently.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was feeling very embarrassed as well as overwhelmed by the way Lán WàngJī touched me, while looking at him with his burning desire written on his eyes.</p>
        <p>He could not help but said, “Lán Zhàn, can you stop looking at me? It’s really embarrassing.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī chuckled, then, gently, he pushed him down on the bed, and lay on the top of Wèi WúXiàn, and then, he began to kiss his lips, slowly moving down and gently biting his neck and shoulder, then, he moved further down, licking and biting Wèi WúXiàn’s nipples.</p>
        <p>For several days, he did not touch Wèi WúXiàn, and, moreover, for two days, Wèi WúXiàn’s body was soaked wet, as a result, his bite marks on Wèi WúXiàn’s skin had all vanished, Lán WàngJī noted.</p>
        <p>After leaving his marks on Wèi WúXiàn, Lán WàngJī, in turn, began to suck both nipples.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn never knew that being touched by the nipples could feel so strong. He could not help but struggle to set himself free.</p>
        <p>This time, however, Lán WàngJī didn’t let him escape. He took Wèi WúXiàn’s wrists, put them above Wèi WúXiàn’s head, and, with one hand, he held both wrists steady on the bed, and then, he carried on sucking his nipples.</p>

        <p>For the most part of the day, Wèi WúXiàn was anxious about misinterpreting Lán WàngJī’s kindness towards him. However, it turned out that, what he had taken earlier as his own fantasy became true.</p>
        <p>And, right now, he was pinned down on the bed, and was kissed and fondled by Lán WàngJī. All this happened at too fast pace for Wèi WúXiàn to cope with.</p>
        <p>As a teenager, Wèi WúXiàn had read a lot of illustrated pornographic books, however, he never came across those that involved two men relationship.</p>
        <p>On top of that, Lán WàngJī’s techniques in bed were exceedingly good, turning what he had learned from books to dust, and leaving him without any other options but to lie down and be at the mercy of Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>However, he was still ashamed to let Lán WàngJī notice his swollen and aching manhood. Yet, with Lán WàngJī’s hands that had already reached his hips, it was only a matter of time before he found out.</p>
        <p>Under the skilful touch of Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn bit his lip so to stop himself from moaning, however, he could not prevent his toes from curling in pleasure, nor his feet from moving uncontrollable.</p>
        <p>Before losing his memories, Wèi WúXiàn would not be subdued so easily, like he was now, lying down submissively and let Lán WàngJī do as his please.</p>
        <p>Now that, in his mind, Wèi WúXiàn was a teenager, Lán WàngJī found him so cute as he tried his best to conceal his reaction; something that he wouldn’t normally do.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then slid his hand inside Wèi WúXiàn’s underwear and held his swollen manhood. As he did, Wèi WúXiàn let out a muttered moan.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, don’t bite your lips.” said Lán WàngJī, then, he put his fingers on Wèi WúXiàn’s lips, and parted them, while his other hand stroked his private parts.</p>
        <p>Then, from Wèi WúXiàn’s lips until his belly button, Lán WàngJī slowly covered this path with light kisses, and, when he reached the belly button, using the tip of his tongue, he licked his navel and around it.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then reached the state of ecstasy, he could no longer bear this excessive pleasure, and called out his name, “Lán Zhàn.”</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, everything is all right.” said Lán WàngJī, then, he began to take off Wèi WúXiàn’s underwear.</p>
        <p>Unconsciously, Wèi WúXiàn raised his hips so to assist Lán WàngJī on his task, then, he felt ashamed from his own action, but it was too later, because his swollen manhood was already in display for Lán WàngJī to admire.</p>
        <p>However, Wèi WúXiàn could not help but closed his legs tight.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī thrust his knee between Wèi WúXiàn’s legs, and opened them up, then, he wrapped his hand around his manhood, and began to rubbed it up an down, introducing some variations by stroking the head with the palm his hand in a circular motion, and also by teasing the small open with his finger.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī knew all Wèi WúXiàn’s erogenous zones, and the latter felt so good that he thought he would die if it carried on like this, wondering why Lán WàngJī so good at it.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, it occurred to him that he should not be the only one to feel good. Wèi WúXiàn sat up so to remove Lán WàngJī’s nightclothes.</p>
        <p>However, Lán WàngJī gently pushed him back on the bed, and said, “Wèi Yīng, don’t move, just leave everything to me.”</p>
        <p>So, Wèi WúXiàn did as he was told, letting Lán WàngJī lead the way.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then lowered his head, and took him deeply into his mouth, and, “Aaah!” Wèi WúXiàn could not suppress a clear and loud moan.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, you don’t need to do that.” Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body was trembling uncontrollable under such surge of sexual pleasure.</p>
        <p>Since Lán WàngJī was expecting Wèi WúXiàn to resist him, he pressed down on Wèi WúXiàn’s hips and legs so to prevent him from wriggling, while he performed fellatio on him.</p>
        <p>Whenever Lán WàngJī wanted to take him into his mouth, Wèi WúXiàn always refused him to do so. At that moment of their love squabble, Lán WàngJī loved watching him trying to resist but fail, trying to escape but never exceed, and the way Wèi WúXiàn would finally surrender to him.</p>
        <p>In the end, Wèi WúXiàn was not able to free himself, because Lán WàngJī’s strength was too great for him to overcome, and was feeling as though Lán WàngJī was sucked each area of his body.</p>
        <p>Inside of Lán WàngJī’s mouth was wet and warm, which added more pleasant feeling, as Lán WàngJī kept on sucking his manhood, as well as licking the head, and teasing the small open with the tip of his tongue.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn could not believe that the person who was at this instance fellating him was none other than Lán WàngJī. So, he closed his eyes tight since he didn’t dare to look at him.</p>
        <p>The pleasure from his lower body was getting higher and higher, the sucking techniques of Lán WàngJī were so good that it became harder for Wèi WúXiàn to restrain himself from crying out loud, as well as from stopping the blood that kept on rushing into his private parts.</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī deeply swallowed him, his throat contracted around the head of Wèi WúXiàn’s manhood. It felt so good that Wèi WúXiàn bit his fingers, which prevented him from moaning.</p>
        <p>“If it carries on like this,” Wèi WúXiàn said inwardly, “I will soon come inside Lán Zhàn’s mouth. I can’t do that to Lán Zhàn. I must not!”</p>
        <p>In his despair, Wèi WúXiàn seemed to have found the salvation that would lessen his raging desire and calm the surge of blood that rushed into his manhood.</p>
        <p>He began to recite the rules of GūsūLán:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <em>Do not rest until the end of the day.</em><br />
            <em>Do not keep sleeping once it’s dawn.</em><br />
            <em>Do not be picky eater.</em><br />
            <em>Do not drink alcohol.</em><br />
            <em>Do not stand or sit incorrectly.</em><br />
            <em>Do not eat more than three bowls of rice a day...</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn remembered the rules that he had copied as a punishment, and, unintentionally, he ended up reciting them aloud.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then raised his head, and said, “Wèi Yīng, you don’t need recite our sect’s rules.”</p>
        <p>However, Wèi WúXiàn refused to listen to Lán WàngJī. The latter understood that Wèi WúXiàn was about to come, but he didn’t want to release in his mouth, so Lán WàngJī used his hand to make him come.</p>
        <p>As he at last ejaculated, Wèi WúXiàn gasped for breath, and his whole body quivered, and then, once it’s done, he sat up.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, I’ll help you, too.” he said.</p>
        <p>However, Lán WàngJī, once more, pushed him back on the bed, then, with his fingers, he collected Wèi WúXiàn’s white fluid, and, gently, he began to rub the open Wèi WúXiàn’s anus, and then, slowly, he inserted a finger into it, and carried on rubbing the inside of the tiny hole.</p>
        <p>Like on their first time, even though he had guessed it, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Lán Zhàn, what did you put in?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī paused and asked, “Can I put mine into here?”</p>
        <p>“What?” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, since he had thought that between men it was only about kissing, hugging and eventually helping each other release by using either a hand or mouth, just like what Lán WàngJī did to him.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī resumed rubbing inside him, causing Wèi WúXiàn to feel a tickling sensation, then, he said, “If you want to help me, let me put mine inside you.”</p>
        <p>“You don’t need to ask, just do it.’ replied Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>So, he let Lán WàngJī broaden his horizons, letting himself to experience something completely new to him.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī carried on rubbing inside Wèi WúXiàn, and, for time to time, he moved his finger in a circular motion, and then, in a low voice, he asked, “Are you all right?”</p>
        <p>In addition of being pinned down, having Lán WàngJī’s finger inside him, and having to see his expression that seemed to say ‘I understand that you know nothing about this, so I will teach you’, Lán WàngJī’s question just added to his embarrassment.</p>
        <p>“I’ve already said to you that you don’t need to ask me. It’s really embarrassing.” Wèi WúXiàn replied.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī seemed to chuckled, then, inserting another finger, he found the P-spot and pressed on it.</p>
        <p>“Aaah! Lán Zhàn!” Wèi WúXiàn moaned loudly, and he almost jumped off the bed, then, inwardly, he wondered, “Why is there something like that inside a man’s body?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī began gently to rub the spot, which caused Wèi WúXiàn to twist his hips in order to escape.</p>
        <p>“You said yourself that I don’t need to ask you.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was defeated by his own words. So, he then stopped struggling and spread up his legs, surrendering himself to Lán WàngJī, and letting him do as he pleased.</p>
        <p>His submission was a delightful pleasure to Lán WàngJī. He became even more determined to make Wèi WúXiàn experience a far greater climax. He began to move his fingers up and down inside him, and then, he put the third finger.</p>
        <p>“Aaah!” Wèi WúXiàn let out a moan. With two fingers, it was already too much for him to bear, now that Lán WàngJī inserted the third one, he could not help but, involuntarily, tightened his buttocks, and curled his toes.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, try to relax.” said Lán WàngJī, then, in order to let Wèi WúXiàn get used to it, he was now moving his fingers less deeper inside him.</p>
        <p>Anxious, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Lán Zhàn, is this really the way it is done? Are you not mistaken?”</p>
        <p>With a smile on his face, Lán WàngJī replied, “Uh-huh, I will show you.” Then, he pressed on the sensitive P-spot, which caused Wèi WúXiàn to reach another climax.</p>
        <p>And then, Wèi WúXiàn spread his legs once more, and said, “Come inside, then.”</p>
        <p>“There is no need to hurry things up.” replied Lán WàngJī. Then, picking up a slow and regular rhythm, he carried on moving his fingers inside Wèi WúXiàn, rubbing his spot, massaging every area inside him so to make the tiny hole loose a little bit.</p>
        <p>Gradually, Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body relaxed, and it seemed to him that the inside of his hole was getting slippery.</p>
        <p>Then, once more, Lán WàngJī covered Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body with light kisses, and the latter kept on moaning under each of his touch.</p>
        <p>Embarrassed by all these moans, Wèi WúXiàn tried his best to restraint himself.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then sucked Wèi WúXiàn’s earlobe, and then, he whispered to his ear, “Wèi Yīng, I want to hear your moans.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn wondered, “Did I hear it wrong? Is it really Lán Zhàn? Such lecherous words coming from his mouth is an extreme sexual arousal.”</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī showed no longer mercy, his fingers went deeper inside Wèi WúXiàn, and, continuously, he rubbed his P-spot, which had, as a result, made Wèi WúXiàn cry out loud.</p>
        <p>Gradually, Lán WàngJī sped up the movements of his fingers inside Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī kept on stimulating his P-spot, Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body was filled with an intense feeling of pleasure, and his mind seemed to float in the air. Then, finally, he released once again.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then stopped moving his fingers, and, slowly, withdrew them, and then, he kissed Wèi WúXiàn on the forehead, which was now covered with tiny little droplets of sweat.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn gazed vacantly in font of him, the open of his hole kept on throbbing, and, for a short while, his mind went blank.</p>
        <p>“Good grief! Just by using his fingers, Lán Zhàn made me come.” inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn said, “I have to return the favour.”</p>
        <p>Then, he sat up, once more, in order to take off Lán WàngJī’s nightclothes, however, he was pushed back on the bed, once again.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī took off his forehead ribbon, loosely tied Wèi WúXiàn’s wrists above the head, then, he secured the ribbon on the bedhead.</p>
        <p>Since the ribbon was not firmly tied around his writs, Wèi WúXiàn could easily free himself, however, he opted not to do it.</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī took off his nightclothes, including his underwear, opened a small black box laid by one corner of the bed, took out a container of ointment, then, he applied ointment on his manhood, despite Wèi WúXiàn being already wet.</p>
        <p>As he lubricated his private parts, Wèi WúXiàn looked at Lán WàngJī’s manhood, and was shocked, “Sheesh! Why are you so big?”</p>
        <p>Then, he wondered, “Will this huge stuff fit in me?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then held Wèi WúXiàn by the hips, and the latter, unconsciously, moved backwards.</p>
        <p>In a gentle tone, Lán WàngJī reassured him, “Wèi Yīng, don’t be afraid. I won’t be ruthless.”</p>
        <p>“Here we go again with his ‘Don’t worry, I’ll teach you’ attitude.” Wèi WúXiàn was little bit annoyed, and quickly replied, “Who is afraid? If you want to put it in, just go ahead. I have plenty of experience.”</p>
        <p>Then, both of them were stunned by the last sentence, since Wèi WúXiàn had said the same thing before.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng!” Lán WàngJī looked at him with an eye that conveyed all his love he had for him, because his words brought him back to their conversation in Baifeng Mountain, just short after he had stolen his first kiss.</p>
        <p>As he had lost his memories, and he didn’t remember that he had already told Lán WàngJī that what he had said, back then, in Baifeng Mountain was a lie, Wèi WúXiàn interpreted Lán WàngJī’s loving expression as ‘Even though you have done it with others, I still love you.’</p>
        <p>So, since he didn’t want Lán WàngJī to have a wrong opinion of him, he hurriedly said, “It’s not true. I don’t have any experience. Trust me. This is my first time doing it with you.”</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī understood that Wèi WúXiàn bragged about his “experience” because he didn’t want to look like a novice.</p>
        <p>As he noticed some change on Lán WàngJī’s expression, Wèi WúXiàn thought that he didn’t believe him.</p>
        <p>So, wrapping his legs around Lán WàngJī’s waist, Wèi WúXiàn said, “I’ve never even held any girl’s hands. Lán Zhàn, you are the only one for me, and, in the future, there will be only you.”</p>
        <p>Then, he felt relieved to have said the truth.</p>
        <p>However, by mentioning girls, Wèi WúXiàn had unknowingly touched a topic that was like a thorn piercing Lán WàngJī’s heart, since the latter was extremely jealous each time Wèi WúXiàn was flirting with girls.</p>
        <p>Reminding himself that, right now, the most important thing was to make Wèi WúXiàn feel good, Lán WàngJī took a deep breath, and suppressed all those old jealousies he had felt.</p>
        <p>He then held the back of Wèi WúXiàn’s knees, and pushed the knees forward until they got close to Wèi WúXiàn’s chest.</p>
        <p>Under this posture, Lán WàngJī had a full view of Wèi WúXiàn’s private parts. </p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn did not recall to have seen such a posture on the erotic books he had read.</p>
        <p>“This is really indecent.” thought Wèi WúXiàn, “Is Lán Zhàn going to put his stuff in this lewd posture? Is this his first time?”</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, look at me. I’m going to put mine inside you.” said Lán WàngJī, then, he held his huge manhood, and inserted only the head, letting Wèi WúXiàn to get used to it.</p>
        <p>After a short while, he added, “Wèi Yīng, watch carefully.” Then, slowly, he inserted the whole stuff.</p>
        <p>“Aaah!” Wèi WúXiàn could not help but moan. He didn’t know what was more stimulant; was it because Lán WàngJī’s deep voice telling him to look, or was it the view of his manhood entering him, or was it the sensation he felt for having Lán WàngJī inside him?</p>
        <p>With Lán WàngJī’s manhood fully inserted inside him, Wèi WúXiàn felt that the inside of his hole was reshaped to fit Lán WàngJī’s size.</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī began to move, slowly making the back and forward motions, so to let Wèi WúXiàn adapt to his size.</p>
        <p>His soft movements, however, were enough to make Wèi WúXiàn let out some soft cries.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī was very gentle, however, at the same time, he seemed to let Wèi WúXiàn know that he was a little bit jealous. And, somehow, Wèi WúXiàn felt good that Lán WàngJī was jealous because of him.</p>
        <p>With the exception of swollen sensation felt when Lán WàngJī entered him, Wèi WúXiàn experienced a great feeling for his “first” time because Lán WàngJī’s plenty of foreplay.</p>
        <p>While making a great effort for not losing control, Lán WàngJī carried on moving slowly and gently inside Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>So, gradually, the swollen sensation that Wèi WúXiàn had felt changed into sexual pleasure. And, all this happened while he was watching.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then felt too embarrassed to keep on watching Lán WàngJī moving inside him, and turned his gaze away.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, don’t look away.” said Lán WàngJī, then, he held Wèi WúXiàn’s chin and made him turn his head towards him.</p>
        <p>Watching Lán WàngJī moving his manhood back and forth inside him, again and again, was indeed very erotic.</p>
        <p>However, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t want to be the only one feeling embarrassed, he asked, “Does it feel good, being inside me?”</p>
        <p>Unknown to him, because of his amnesia, this was not the first time he asked Lán WàngJī this question. In other words, the latter had already got used to it.</p>
        <p>So, by observing Wèi WúXiàn’s expression, Lán WàngJī saw through him, he replied, “It does feel good.” then, he asked, “Do you want me to move fast?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn felt that his face was suddenly burned with embarrassment by Lán WàngJī’s question.</p>
        <p>Noting that Wèi WúXiàn got used to his huge stuff, Lán WàngJī began to move faster and vigorously, bumping every small area inside Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Soon after, the sound of the back and forth motion became audible, and some white foam began to form, and circled around Lán WàngJī’s manhood.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn didn’t dare to watch any longer, so, he closed his eyes. However, the fact of closing his eyes made him feel Lán WàngJī even more intensively. The sexual pleasure slid along his spine, and carried on throughout his whole body, including his fingertips and toes.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, don’t close your eyes. Keep watching.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then obeyed, and opened his eyes just as Lán WàngJī moved his huge stuff back, displaying a full view of his manhood covered with white fluid.</p>
        <p>The watery sound coming from his hole seemed to have increased, as Lán WàngJī now moved his stuff forth, deeply penetrating inside him, and making Wèi WúXiàn feel extremely good, that he reached the high point.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn thought that it was too much. With his wrists still loosely tied above his head, he scratched on the framework of the bedhead with his fingers.</p>
        <p>The stimulating view of being penetrated over and over, and the pleasure that these back and forth movements provided kept on piling up within him.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn.” he called in low voice. Wèi WúXiàn was overwhelmed under such extreme pleasure.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī seemed to have smiled, he leaned forward and gave Wèi WúXiàn a light kiss on the lips. Then, as though he was stimulated by Wèi WúXiàn calling his name, Lán WàngJī began to move much faster and intensively.</p>
        <p>“Ah... ah... ahh... agh... Lán Zhàn, I’m still a virgin.” said Wèi WúXiàn between moans and gasps.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī simply replied, “I know.” However, he didn’t slow down, but kept on bumping faster and harder.</p>
        <p>Although Wèi WúXiàn’s posture was not quite comfortable, Lán WàngJī’s repetitive and vigorous back and forth motions were really making him feel extremely good under this posture.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn kept on moaning louder and louder, feeling an intense sensation from his hole, and his swollen manhood began to ache.</p>
        <p>Since he had intensified his movements, Lán WàngJī was afraid that Wèi WúXiàn would not be able to keep up, so, he decided to change Wèi WúXiàn’s posture.</p>
        <p>He rested Wèi WúXiàn’s legs on his shoulders, grabbed few pillows and put them under Wèi WúXiàn’s loins.</p>
        <p>Following Lán WàngJī’s action, Wèi WúXiàn seemed to understand why, earlier, he had noticed that there were so many pillows on the bed.</p>
        <p>However, he could not ponder on the matter much longer, because Lán WàngJī now rose his buttocks, and placed them in the way that he could hit directly Wèi WúXiàn’s weak spot, then, he resumed bumping inside him.</p>
        <p>“Aaah... Lán Zhàn... agh... it feels so good... I can’t take it any more... I’m coming again.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then held Wèi WúXiàn’s swollen manhood, and began to rub it up and down, while he kept on pounding inside him.</p>
        <p>And, soon after, like a volcano in eruption, a series of white fluids was ejected from it, while Wèi WúXiàn was crying and trembling uncontrollably, and, at the same time, Lán WàngJī was also releasing inside him.</p>
        <p>After a short while, Wèi WúXiàn said while panting, “Agh... Lán Zhàn, you’re really awesome.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then leaned over him, and began to stroke his upper body gently and softly, then, he moved his hand down, fondling Wèi WúXiàn’s hips.</p>
        <p>Under Lán WàngJī’s caress, Wèi WúXiàn felt so fulfilled that he freed his wrists from the ribbon, wrapped his arms around Lán WàngJī’s neck, and began to kiss him tenderly.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī held him tight and kissed him back.</p>
        <p>The overwhelming pleasure that Wèi WúXiàn felt slowly quietened down. They were now surrounded by a tranquil atmosphere.</p>
        <p>However, in this serene mood, Lán WàngJī’s huge stuff was still erect.</p>
        <p>Soon, he began to move again inside Wèi WúXiàn, and the latter, surprised, called out, “Lán Zhàn!”</p>
        <p>As a reply to the call, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, that will take a while. ”</p>

        <p>“HánGuāng-Jūn, am I not injured?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“By no means.” Lán WàngJī replied.</p>
        <p>“Really? You did it so hard.”</p>
        <p>“Then, let me have a look.” Lán WàngJī stopped moving and pulled out his manhood.</p>
        <p>“What?!” cried Wèi WúXiàn, then, he set himself free from Lán WàngJī’s arms, put some distance between them, and then, he added, “What do you mean by having a look? I was joking.”</p>
        <p>Without saying anything, Lán WàngJī reached out for the black box, and took out the same ointment as before.</p>
        <p>Although he perfectly knew that he didn’t injure Wèi WúXiàn, especially that this night was his “first time”, still, he wanted to apply the salve on Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Back then, on their first day, Lán WàngJī felt a little bit bitter afterwards, because he had injured Wèi WúXiàn due to his lack of experience; he didn’t know that he should have applied an ointment.</p>
        <p>Therefore, this time, he didn’t want to make the same mistake.</p>
        <p>Seeing what Lán WàngJī was holding on his hand, Wèi WúXiàn began to wonder, “Is it not the ointment? Why does he need it for?” then, he realised, “Don’t tell me that he’s going to apply it there! No way! It’s so embarrassing.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s first react was to run away, however, he was rooted to the spot by Lán WàngJī’s glance.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, you’re not allow to leave the bed.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Then, he held Wèi WúXiàn’s ankles, and gently pulled him back. And then, he put Wèi WúXiàn’s legs on his shoulders, once more, and rose his buttocks.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn thought, “Earlier, he induced me to watch, and now, he coaxes me to let him have a look.”</p>
        <p>However, this time, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t want to be subdued so easily.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, I’m really fine. I don’t need that.” Wèi WúXiàn implored.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī paid no heed to his demand. After raising Wèi WúXiàn buttocks, he now used his fingers to probe the open of the hole, then, he put two fingers inside, and slightly spread the hole.</p>
        <p>Everything was all right, and, with this posture, while applying the ointment, it would not leak out, thought Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Then, after taking some portion of the salve, he began gently to apply it on Wèi WúXiàn’s hole.</p>
        <p>“Agh...” Wèi WúXiàn moaned. He could not help it, especially after being bumped so vigorously.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī massaged the hole by making circular motions with his fingers, softly rubbing the inside, which still had his white fluid, and, moreover, it produced a clear sound as his fingers moved about the hole.</p>
        <p>Becoming embarrassed by the erotic sound, Wèi WúXiàn began slightly to twist his hips so to avoid Lán WàngJī’s touch.</p>
        <p>The more Lán WàngJī excelled in his way of making him feel good, the more embarrassing it became for Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Are you okay?” asked Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Um, it feels a little bit cold.” he replied, then, “Lán Zhàn, can I do it on my own?”</p>
        <p>“No, you can’t.”</p>
        <p>Although he didn’t plan on applying the ointment on Wèi WúXiàn, however, since it had crossed his mind, he might as well do it himself, and do it properly for Wèi WúXiàn’s sake.</p>
        <p>Back then, everything happened very fast, like a dry woods catching fire, and, in a instant, everything turned into a blazing fire.</p>
        <p>He was not mentally prepared for it, and was caught by the fire of his own long-holding-back desire, and unleashed his passions that he could scarcely control.</p>
        <p>He had frenetically moved inside Wèi WúXiàn, over and over, since, at that time, he had felt that it was not enough for him to stop, that his desire had not been quenched yet.</p>
        <p>If only, back then, he had taken good care of him, he would not be injured.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī withdrew his fingers to take some more ointment, then, he applied it directly on Wèi WúXiàn’s sensitive area.</p>
        <p>From now on, there would be other occasions to mend his past mistake. So, for now, Lán WàngJī didn’t want to be distracted by what happened back then, he only wanted to make Wèi WúXiàn feel happy and fully satisfied.</p>
        <p>“Agh...” However, Wèi WúXiàn could not bear his touch, and his breath gradually became heavy, because, not long ago, he had an orgasm, and, as a result, his whole body became very sensitive to withstand an erotic massage. Naturally, his manhood began to react.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, can you let me lie on my stomach?” he asked, so that, in this position, Lán WàngJī would not notice his reaction.</p>
        <p>“No, I can’t.” he replied, and also, he noticed that Wèi WúXiàn was getting hard.</p>
        <p>“At least, don’t raise my bottom so high.” Wèi WúXiàn was really embarrassed.</p>
        <p>“That won’t do.” he stopped moving his fingers inside Wèi WúXiàn, and added, “This position allows me to see inside more clearly.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then began to twist left and right.</p>
        <p>In an earnest tone, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, this is just a mere application of the ointment.”</p>
        <p>Then, he resumed his massage by skilfully drawing circles around Wèi WúXiàn’s weak area, which caused more sexual arousal in Wèi WúXiàn that he began to tremble.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn could not help but grab Lán WàngJī’s hand, and then, he asked, “Lán Zhàn, are you not doing this on purpose?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, I am.”</p>
        <p>“What!?” Wèi WúXiàn didn’t expect Lán WàngJī to admit it so easily.</p>
        <p>“Before, it was not. But now, I’m doing it deliberately.” At the instant he had seen Wèi WúXiàn’s little erection, Lán WàngJī had purposely began to arouse him even more.</p>
        <p>Then, he pressed hard on Wèi WúXiàn’s P-spot.</p>
        <p>“Aaah... Lán Zhàn!” As expected, Wèi WúXiàn spasmed violently, and his manhood got harder.</p>
        <p>“Come on, Lán Zhàn, stop fooling around. If you want to do it, then do it.”</p>
        <p>For a brief instant, a feint smile seemed to have appeared on Lán WàngJī’s face. He pulled out his fingers, and, with the ointment slimily wrapped around his fingers, he applied it around the open of the hole.</p>
        <p>And then, once more, using his forehead ribbon that was still around the bedhead, Lán WàngJī tied Wèi WúXiàn’s wrists. This time, however, he firmly tied them before securing the ribbon on the bedhead.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, the meaning of wearing GūsūLán’s forehead ribbon is to restrain yourself. ” said Lán WàngJī in his deep voice that resounded inside Wèi WúXiàn’s ears.</p>
        <p>He carried on, “Only in the presence of a soulmate, the person you love, that there is no need to restrain yourself.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then leaned over Wèi WúXiàn, and slightly bit his lower lip, then, he said, “Wèi Yīng, I love you.” And then, he looked at him with tenderness. Meanwhile, Wèi WúXiàn’s heart was beating fast.</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī earnestly said, “Wèi Yīng, you and I are a married couple.” His gaze was getting hotter, and Wèi WúXiàn felt as though he was floating in the air.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, he was feeling really embarrassed, and now, it seemed to him that he was surrounded by a beautiful scenery, just like in a fairyland. Wèi WúXiàn was so dumbfounded by what he just learned that he was unable to utter a single word.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī felt a little bit disappointed. It seemed that this time he would not hear Wèi WúXiàn’s passionate confession.</p>
        <p>However, for now, it did not matter, because, the current Wèi WúXiàn didn’t have any painful past, nor having nightmares. Everything was perfect and harmonious, and, as long as Wèi WúXiàn was happy and satisfied, that was all that counted to Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>He then kissed his lips, moved close to his ear and licked his earlobe, and then, he slightly sucked it.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, he whispered to Wèi WúXiàn’s ear, “Wèi Yīng, I want you. Doing it only once is not enough.”</p>
        <p>“Agh!” These whispers were enough to turn him on. And, as a response to Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn wrapped his legs around Lán WàngJī’s waist.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then resumed licking and sucking Wèi WúXiàn’s earlobe, then, he carried down to his neck, and softly bit Wèi WúXiàn’s Adam’s apple.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, he slid his hand between Wèi WúXiàn’s legs, then, he inserted two fingers deeply inside his body. And, from his fingertips, Lán WàngJī released a thin stream of his spiritual power, which hit directly onto Wèi WúXiàn’s weak spot.</p>
        <p>“Aaah... Agh... Lán Zhàn...” A sudden and intense pleasure travelled from his weak spot through his whole body, causing him to tremble uncontrollably.</p>
        <p>In fact, using spiritual power there was forbidden.</p>
        <p>Since he was always eager to try new techniques, Wèi WúXiàn had suggested it to Lán WàngJī. So, when the latter actually used it during their foreplay, Wèi WúXiàn found it too intense to bear. So, he wrote it to their Jingshi’s rules as a forbidden technique.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then looked at him, and, in a soothing voice, he said, “Wèi Yīng, leave everything to me.”</p>
        <p>Then, he moved down between Wèi WúXiàn’s legs, and took his already-upright manhood into his mouth.</p>
        <p>While performing fellatio on Wèi WúXiàn, Lán WàngJī alternately released gentle and strong stream of the spiritual power through his two fingers, which were still inside Wèi WúXiàn, and kept on arousing Wèi WúXiàn’s sexual pleasure.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī wanted to make Wèi WúXiàn’s “first time” be exceptionally an unforgettable experience.</p>
        <p>He wanted him to savour every of his moves inside him, to enjoy every pleasure that he gave him.</p>
        <p>He wanted him to experience great climaxes, to cry when he penetrated deeply inside him, and surrendered to him completely.</p>
        <p>He wanted him to feel him when he came inside him, and blended with him body and soul.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn... Lán Zhàn...” With the stream of the spiritual power hitting his P-spot, and his manhood being sucked, and, from time to time, the head got squeezed by the wall of Lán WàngJī’s throat, Wèi WúXiàn lost control and began to kick Lán WàngJī in the back.</p>
        <p>“My darling...” Wèi WúXiàn unconsciously said the words that he usually used when he begged for mercy. Then, his whole body convulsed, and, at the same, he released inside Lán WàngJī’s mouth.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī swallowed his fluid, pulled out his fingers from Wèi WúXiàn’s hole, and, vigorously, he inserted his huge manhood deeply inside him.</p>

    <div>
        <p>After releasing his white fluid, Wèi WúXiàn fell into state of languor, and Lán WàngJī, while he was still inside him, began the process of dual cultivation.</p>
        <p>Since, after losing a golden core, a new one could be formed within seven days, and there were still three days left, since Wèi WúXiàn went missing for two days, and was in a coma for another two days, Lán WàngJī decided to perform the dual cultivation without further delay.</p>
        <p>However, to begin the process of dual cultivation, Lán WàngJī needed to penetrate into the realm of Wèi WúXiàn’s conscious mind. Once inside, he began to channel through it using his spiritual power.</p>
        <p>While channelling, Lán WàngJī could see in Wèi WúXiàn’s memories a series of images of what happened around Wèi WúXiàn since he woke up this morning, as well as the people he met and told to, including himself.</p>
        <p>Entering the realm of the conscious mind was similar to the empathy, where you invited the spirit of a deceased person to enter your body in order to penetrate into their memory.</p>
        <p>Once the spirit of the dead was inside you, you would be able to hear what they heard, observe what they saw, and feel what they felt. This process helped in discovering information that only the deceased person knew about it.</p>
        <p>Although both, empathy and channelling, were similar, however, the process of a spirit entering your body was much easier compared to the process of penetrating into the realm of someone’s conscious mind.</p>
        <p>This was because the deceased people no longer possessed the spiritual veins*.</p>
        <small>*In Chinese martial arts, spiritual veins, also known as meridians, are believed to be the paths in which the life-energy known as Qi flows. In this story, Qi is the spiritual power.</small>
        <p>Inside the living beings, spiritual veins forged a barrier that protected the realm of the conscious mind, hence, preventing anyone from invading other people’s mind. Even for ordinary people with low spiritual power, their conscious minds were also protected.</p>
        <p>However, with his brilliant mind, Wèi WúXiàn succeeded in finding an easy method to enter the realm of the conscious mind, where other cultivators before him had tried but failed.</p>
        <p>He had found out that during the intercourse, people became defenceless due to the intense pleasure. So, at that crucial moment, using the semen as the medium, they could overcome that barrier, and penetrate into the realm of the conscious mind to perform the channelling.</p>
        <p>This process also required the one who wanted to penetrate into the other’s conscious mind to enter their own conscious mind first.</p>
        <p>Once you were inside the realm of your partner’s conscious mind, and began to channel, you would be able to detect the most important paths of the spiritual veins.</p>
        <p>Beyond the realm of the conscious mind was the realm of the unconscious mind.</p>
        <p>If you channelled deeper and penetrated into the realm of your partner’s unconscious mind, you would be able to discover their deepest desire, even modify their habits.</p>
        <p>If you were a high-level cultivator, you would be to control the flow of your partner’s spiritual power, which streamed through the spiritual veins.</p>
        <p>However, to be able to gain access to the realm of the unconscious mind required your partner to have an absolute trust in you, otherwise, you would be rejected, instinctively.</p>
        <p>Before Wèi WúXiàn went missing, while they were performing the dual cultivation, Lán WàngJī was able to see the flow of Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual power through his spiritual veins, without entering the realm of Wèi WúXiàn’s unconscious mind.</p>
        <p>This was because the level of Lán WàngJī’s cultivation was the most powerful. And also, the using of his semen was not only to pass through the barrier, but also to help them blend together their conscious minds.</p>
        <p>Since Wèi WúXiàn did no longer have his golden core, which generated a high amount of the spiritual power, Wèi WúXiàn’s current spiritual power became as weak as an ordinary person.</p>
        <p>So, after spotting the flow of Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual power, Lán WàngJī used his own spiritual power to guide the flow through the spiritual veins.</p>
        <p>He also opened up the main paths of Wèi WúXiàn ‘s spiritual veins. Hence, the whole process took less effort to be completed.</p>
        <p>After the channelling, Lán WàngJī was certain that in near future, a golden core would begin to form inside Wèi WúXiàn’s golden core vessel, that there was no need to enter his unconscious mind.</p>
        <p>During the channelling, Lán WàngJī saw himself in the memories of Wèi WúXiàn, when, one evening, both of them were in Jingshi, and he was reading a book aloud for Wèi WúXiàn. It was Wèi WúXiàn’s favourite story. When he finished, he told him to go to bed since Wèi WúXiàn became sleepy.</p>
        <p>After that channelling, Lán WàngJī found out that Wèi WúXiàn’s usual sleeping time had changed, as well as his favourite sentence of the story.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī believed that he was the one who caused these changes during the channelling, because his spiritual power was much stronger than that of Wèi WúXiàn, and, as a result, he tampered with Wèi WúXiàn’s habits.</p>
        <p>Since channelling through the realm of the unconscious mind could allowed one to alter the other’s wishes and habits, Lán WàngJī didn’t want these kind of things to happen to Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Therefore, during their dual cultivation, they always operated in the realm of the conscious mind, and, step by step, they worked together to accomplish their goal.</p>
        <p>However, Wèi WúXiàn was not as cautious as Lán WàngJī was, he said, “Ér Gege*, I trust you. So, you can go deeper and enter the realm of my unconscious mind. In that way, you’ll be able to accelerate the whole process.”</p>
        <small>*Since ‘Second Brother’ sounds weird in English language, from now on Ér Gege will be used instead. The correct pronunciation of Ér Gege is on the sidebar.</small>
        <p>Seeing that Lán WàngJī was not happy about his suggestion, Wèi WúXiàn did not insist.</p>
        <p>He then put his arms around Lán WàngJī’s neck, and, in a coquettish way, he said, “Ér Gege, don’t worry. It’s fine if you don’t want to do it. Just help me open up the main paths of my spiritual veins, I’ll do the rest. I promise that I’ll work hard to strengthen my foundation.”</p>
        <p>However, after Wèi WúXiàn went missing, Lán WàngJī blamed himself for being so cautious at that time. If only he had listened to Wèi WúXiàn, and entered his unconscious mind to help him quickly form a golden core, and solidify it, Wèi WúXiàn’s life would not be at stake.</p>
        <p>On that day, when he had traced Wèi WúXiàn’s signal-transmitter talisman, and only found Suíbiàn with the baby girl, for a moment, his mind went blank. Instinctively, he knew that something had happened to Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>And, during those two days of searching him, Lán WàngJī had tried hard to focus his spiritual power on WàngJī, despite being in constant agony.</p>
        <p>Somehow, he was sure that Wèi WúXiàn was still alive, but he was afraid that it would take long to find him, just like last time.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī knew that he would not bear to spend another long periods of waiting for him to return. So, from now on, he would not let him be out of his sight again, and keep protecting him day and night.</p>
        <p>At the time he was found, his Wèi Yīng was chilled to the bone, the same Wèi Yīng whom he pampered every day, and kept him warm every time he felt cold. But, for two days, his Wèi Yīng was soaked in the cold river without him being by his side to keep him warm.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī swore to make up for it. And also, he decided that from now on, he would listen to him, and let him do whatever it pleased him to do.</p>

    <div>
        <p>Since Wèi WúXiàn’s new golden core had shattered into pieces, and scattered in his spiritual veins, the only way to gather all the fragments was to penetrate into the realm of his unconscious mind.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s current spiritual power was too weak to collect those fragments, and form a golden core on its own within three days.</p>
        <p>And, if the fragments of his golden core happened to melt completely in his spiritual veins, it would be no longer possible to form another golden core.</p>
        <p>During their dual cultivation, since Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual power was weak, Lán WàngJī was using his own spiritual power to guide the flow of Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual power.</p>
        <p>However, by doing so, their both spiritual powers blended together, and, as a result, when the new golden core was formed, its properties were similar to the properties of Lán WàngJī’s golden core.</p>
        <p>That why Suíbiàn recognised Lán WàngJī as its owner instead of Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī knew that, in order to gather all the fragments of Wèi WúXiàn’s golden core, he had to penetrate into the realm of Wèi WúXiàn’s unconscious mind, then use again his semen as the medium to blend their unconscious minds, as well as their spiritual powers.</p>
        <p>And, since their golden cores shared the same properties, Lán WàngJī would use his golden core to trace those fragments that were scattered in Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual veins.</p>
        <p>When he would enter his unconscious mind and begin to channel, Lán WàngJī might discover Wèi WúXiàn’s most desire, as well as watching the images of Wèi WúXiàn’s deepest memories.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn had fallen asleep. However, Lán WàngJī really wanted to enter his unconscious mind while he was awake. He wanted him to reach yet another climax, blended their souls and bodies together.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he began to dive deeper, then succeeded in penetrating into the realm of Wèi WúXiàn unconscious mind.  Once inside, he closed his eyes for a moment to listen to the flow of Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual power, then, he opened his eyes and began to channel.</p>
        <p>Inside Wèi WúXiàn’s unconscious mind was all dark and silent, like being in an empty space deprived of any source of light and sound. It was so quiet that Lán WàngJī could even hear his own breath and heartbeat.</p>
        <p>It seemed like a long time had passed before Lán WàngJī began to hear some whispers.</p>
        <p>Those faint voices seemed to come from far, travelling like a gentle breeze at first, then, gradually, they became distinct and abundant.</p>
        <p>The voices appeared to be some fragments of Wèi WúXiàn’s memories, coming all over the place in a chaotic manner.</p>
        <p>In order to distinguish every speech of these voices, Lán WàngJī closed his eyes again and began to concentrate.</p>
        <p>Then, by focusing on one memory, he recognised the scene; Wèi WúXiàn and he were in Cold Spring of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, back when they were teenagers.</p>
        <p>“Stop splashing around.” “But water is so cold.” “What are you doing?” “I’m just coming towards where you are, because water is warmer around you.”</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī caught another scene; it was when Wèi WúXiàn confessed his love to him.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn! Lán WàngJī! HánGuāng-Jūn! Earlier, I sincerely wanted to sleep with you!” “Lán Zhàn, listen to me.” “I really have a bad memory. I don’t remember everything that happened in the past, included that night .”</p>
        <p>“You are really wonderful. I like you.” “In other words, I love you. I want you. I can’t bear to be parted from you. ” “I want to spend the rest of my life Night-Hunting with you.”</p>
        <p>“I want to sleep with you every single day.”  “I swear I’m not teasing you like I did before, nor expressing my gratitude to you.” “It’s simply because I love you.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t want anyone unless it’s you.” “It can’t be anyone but you.” “You can do whatever you want with me, as long as you are willing to be with me.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then carried on listening to another deepest memory of Wèi WúXiàn, and then another, and so on, until he suddenly released that Wèi WúXiàn’s memories were all about him.</p>
        <p>That would explained why his Wèi Yīng remembered ‘WàngXiàn’, the name of the tune he hummed to him earlier. Although Wèi WúXiàn knew the tune since they were teenagers, however, he didn’t know the name back then.</p>
        <p>That would also explained why his Wèi Yīng was able to read his facial expression, and felt his pain this morning. Even though Wèi WúXiàn’s memories were gone, however, his feeling for him was still there.</p>
        <p>And, in turn, this would explained why his Wèi Yīng could naturally touch him and let be touched by him, as well as trusting him completely; he felt at ease by his side to the extent that he could easily and deeply fall asleep.</p>
        <p>That why his Wèi Yīng fell in love with him again.</p>
        <p>Also, his Wèi Yīng had promised him that, from now on, he would remember everything he would do or say to him, that he wouldn’t any longer forget any of them.</p>
        <p>Hence, all these precious memories were still there, deep in his unconscious mind.</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī carried on channelling further, the voices gradually faded away. And, soon, he reached the core Wèi WúXiàn’s unconscious mind.</p>
        <p>In front of him, there was some sort of cave, and the inside of that cave was dimly lighted.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī stepped into the cave, and saw two people, one was Wèi WúXiàn, sitting on the floor with his back leaned against the wall, and the other was himself, half-knelt in front of Wèi WúXiàn, and both of them were covered with blood.</p>
        <p>The other Lán WàngJī was holding Wèi WúXiàn’s hands, and, earnestly, he was saying something to him. However, Lán WàngJī could not catch anything of what the other him was saying.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then walked closer to them in order to hear what the other him was saying to Wèi WúXiàn, but, still, his attempt was in vain.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, however, he was able to see such a tenderness in Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes as he looked at the other him. He also heard him saying in a gentle voice, “All right, Lán Zhàn, I will go with you. Please, take me home.”</p>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn tenderly put his both hands on the other Lán WàngJī’s cheeks, and began to repeat his words. As he did so, his voice was getting louder, while his tone becoming resolved.</p>
        <p>Then, finally, he shouted, “Lán Zhàn, take me to GūsūLán!”</p>
        <p>And, all of a sudden, their surroundings was replaced with a beautiful scenery full of colourful flowers and luxuriant green grass.</p>
        <p>As for Lán WàngJī, he was filled with happiness by these simple words. No wonder his Wèi Yīng said this morning, “I won’t go. If you don’t want me to go, then I’ll stay with you.”</p>
        <p>Earlier, he felt a little bit disappointed because instead of a silence from Wèi WúXiàn, he was expecting another vehement confession.</p>
        <p>“How foolish I was!” thought Lán WàngJī, “I no longer need any proof of love from Wèi Yīng. His shouted words just now was the best* confession.”</p>
        <small>*Before Wèi WúXiàn’s death, Lán WàngJī has pestered him to come with him to GūsūLán, (that was his clumsy way of saying ‘I love you’ to Wèi WúXiàn). And now, finally, Wèi WúXiàn returns his feeling by saying ‘Take me to GūsūLán’.</small>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng.” in his deep voice, Lán WàngJī called him to get his attention.</p>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn turned his head and looked at him. Meanwhile, the other Lán WàngJī began to fade away.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then positioned himself at the exact place the other him was, and held Wèi WúXiàn’s hands, while Wèi WúXiàn appeared to be stunned.</p>
        <p>In a voice full of tenderness, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, I’ll take you with me back to GūsūLán.”</p>
        <p>Then, with a bright smile on his face, Wèi WúXiàn quickly hugged Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī also embraced him in his arms. And, when Wèi WúXiàn raised his head towards him, they fondly kissed each other.</p>
        <p>After their kisses, the scenery changed again. Now, they were in Jingshi.</p>
        <p>In their room, Bìchén and Suíbiàn were hanged on the wall, some music notes were on the table, and their shelf was filled with various books and rare objects that Wèi WúXiàn brought home whenever he visited a place.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then carried Wèi WúXiàn to the bed, and then, he slowly removed Wèi WúXiàn’s clothes, then, he did the same with his clothes.</p>
        <p>Once both of them were naked, Lán WàngJī lay on the top of Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng.” He gently began to call him again and again, while caressing his soft skin. They were in perfect harmony, blended by the love they felt for each other.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then closed his eyes, and released a flow of his spiritual power. The blue light spread like circular ripples, then, some gentle notes of music, which seemed to be emitted by Wangji, filled the room.</p>
        <p>Soon after, the fragments of Wèi WúXiàn’s golden core slowly began to gather until they formed a perfect and shiny golden sphere.</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī guided the golden core to Wèi WúXiàn’s golden core vessel.</p>
