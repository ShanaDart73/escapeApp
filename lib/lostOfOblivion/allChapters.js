            <p><b>Translator Note:</b></p>
            <p>Modaozushi (The Founder of Demonic Cultivation) is Mo Xiong Tong Xiu's masterpiece that has inspired many authors to write a side story, and, as a big fan of Modaozushi, this side story has caught my attention because Hua Guan Xiu Wei, the writer, has kept the same spirit of the original work.</p>
            <p>The original title of this story when translated in English doesn't make any sense at all, so I call it 'Lost of Oblivion' because, in this story, Wèi WúXiàn loses his happy memories spent with Lán WàngJī, yet, as oblivious as he was of his own feelings towards Lán WàngJī back when they were teenagers, this time, however, he becomes aware of it, and I find his awareness so cute that I decide to give the story this title.</p>

        <br />
        <p>“Wèi qiánbèi*...” cried Yú XiǎoShān, overwhelming with remorse.</p>
        <small>*qiánbèi: a title addressed to someone older than oneself.</small>
        <p>Three hours ago, Yú XiǎoShān was assigned along with other teenagers to check the performance of the Requiem spell, which was cast on the Red Maple slope.</p>
        <p>Then, they would fly on their swords to patrol all the areas of the upper reaches of Han River.</p>
        <p>However, right now, Wèi WúXiàn spotted a pitch dark pond that they had overlooked. On close inspection, it was hard to determine the depth of the pond.</p>
        <p>At the centre, bubbles were constantly rising to the surface, like boiling water. However, when they actually touched the water, it felt icy-cold, like freezing water of a harsh winter.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled, and said, “Lán Zhàn, this promises to be interesting.”</p>
        <p>All teenagers understood that there was a need to investigate the pond. So, full of energy, the disciples of the YúnmèngJiāng sect* were already gearing up to dive in. Each of them wanted to show their swimming skills to the teenagers of the GūsūLán clan*.</p>
        <small>*‘sect’ term refers to all members of the sect, while ‘clan’ term refers to only blood-related members of the family that owns the sect.</small>
        <p>Yú XiǎoShān was the eldest grandson of the MéishānYú clan. Since he was a child, he had an outstanding spiritual power and extraordinary talent. Furthermore, he was highly praised when he was studying at Lotus Pier*.</p>
        <small>*Lotus Pier is the name of the residence of the YúnmèngJiāng sect.</small>
        <p>He was the first to put forward his proposal, he said, “Wèi qiánbèi, I am good at swimming. May I take the lead?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled, and said, “Okay. But you have to be careful. This pond is a little bit weird.”</p>
        <p>Yú XiǎoShān was young, lacking good judgement. The more he was told to be careful, the less he cared.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng*, I will dive with them because the water is too cold. However, Lán Yù and Lán Héng are not good at swimming. So, they will stay with you here, on the bank.”</p>
        <small>*Wèi Yīng: Yīng is the “first” name given from birth (same goes for Zhàn in Lán Zhàn), while WúXiàn and WàngJī are given later on.</small>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Okay.”</p>
        <p>To prevent them from freezing to death, each teenager wrapped their whole body with their spiritual power.</p>
        <p>Impatient to show off, Yú XiǎoShān went ahead and dived in.</p>
        <p>Fast and agile, Yú XiǎoShān was swimming like a fish. And, on his way down, he noticed that the water was undisturbed. He also observed some small fish swimming about, but he didn’t detect anything unusual.</p>
        <p>Yú XiǎoShān said to himself, “There is nothing special about this pond.” Then, he sped up his pace, and, soon after, he saw the bubbles streaming upwards, and decided to follow their source.</p>
        <p>At the bottom of the pond, Yú XiǎoShān found a stout and magnificent stone pillar. And, on the surface of the pillar, there was a huge spiral pattern.</p>
        <p>Following closely behind, Lán WàngJī also saw the stone pillar. He gestured at the rest of the teenagers to surround the pillar.</p>
        <p>Worried that the disciples of the GūsūLán clan would outstrip him, Yú XiǎoShān picked up speed towards the base of the stone pillar.</p>
        <p>However, upon reaching the bottom, his field of vision was blocked by a few long grey “ribbons”.</p>
        <p>Those “ribbons” were floating in front of Yú XiǎoShān, occasionally, tickling his face.</p>
        <p>Before Lán WàngJī could stop him, Yú XiǎoShān impulsively grabbed the “ribbons” and pulled them hard.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, a very big pair of eyes like two huge lanterns appeared in front of him.</p>
        <p>These enormous eyes were so bright that they illuminated the bottom of the pond, while being frightening at the same time.</p>
        <p>It turned out that the spiral pattern was in fact the body of a colossal beast. This creature had coiled itself upside down around the stone pillar. And, it was its beard that Yú XiǎoShān pulled, causing it to wake up from its sleep.</p>
        <p>And then, a very loud and furious roar stormed, sending strong vibrations, which almost damaged everyone’s eardrums.</p>
        <p>The roar of the beast caused the water of the pond to be in turmoil. And, this commotion struck fear into everyone's heart.</p>
        <p>Get out of water! Quick!</p>
        <p>Like having the devil at their heels, everyone at once began to swim upwards.</p>
        <p>One by one, Lán WàngJī led the teenagers to emerge from the water. And, for a while, there was a rush of the youngsters surfacing one after another.</p>
        <p>Once out of the water, each teenager summoned their sword, and flew to the bank.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the colossal beast kept on stirring the water, turning the centre of the pond into a huge vortex.</p>
        <p>Lán Qí, a teenager from GūsūLán clan, who had just stepped on his sword, but hadn’t the time to steady himself, was caught in the vortex.</p>
        <p>“Lán Qí!” cried out Wèi WúXiàn in terror.</p>
        <p>At that instant, a bright blue light swept in the air. Lán WàngJī was already next to Lán Qí, picked him up, and flew to the bank.</p>
        <p>Yú XiǎoShān, who had swum deeper than others, fell behind. As he surfaced and got on his sword, he felt a threatening presence behind him, and he couldn’t help but turn his head.</p>
        <p>He saw a camel-like head, two deer-like horns, a snake-like neck, eagle-like claws, and a body fully covered with carp-like scales. The best had an embedded pearl on its chin, a long grey beard, and some upward scales on its throat.</p>
        <p>He also observed a huge pair of golden eyes fiercely staring at him.</p>
        <p>It was a young dragon! A young dragon that would soon become a fully fledged dragon.</p>
        <p>The young dragon opened its dreadful mouth, and, like a tsunami, it launched itself towards Yú XiǎoShān.</p>
        <p>Yú XiǎoShān was helplessly looking at the young dragon that would soon devour him. He was so terrified that he could no longer move. His legs began to wobble, almost causing him to fall off from his sword.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, from the corner of his eye, he noticed a flash of red light. He didn’t have the time to react that, in the very next instant, he was thrust towards the bank by Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>To fly as fast as he could, Wèi WúXiàn used all his spiritual power. Now, he felt exhausted. Furthermore, since there was no more spiritual power left to feed his sword, Wèi WúXiàn could no longer make Suíbiàn* move.</p>
        <small>*Suíbiàn is the name of Wèi WúXiàn’s sword.</small>
        <p>The open mouth of the young dragon was getting closer, and, not only Wèi WúXiàn could see its sharp teeth and blood-red tongue, but also his field of vision was filled with its monstrous mouth.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn could even smell the stench of rotten meat reeking from its mouth; the smell of death.</p>
        <p>He thought to himself, “This is not the first time I am facing death.”</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng!”</p>
        <p>As soon as this well-known voice to him reached his ears, instantly, the owner of that voice occupied Wèi WúXiàn’s mind completely.</p>
        <p>His voice, which was always gentle and calm, now sounded like a white crane crying out in pain.</p>
        <p>To hear such a great distress in his voice hurt Wèi WúXiàn’s heart profoundly.</p>
        <p>Then, time seemed to stand still, and, although this vast world was populated, at that instant, the world became an empty place, except for only that person.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s heart began to beat rapidly. He then sensed a flow of spiritual power rushing through his veins.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn!” said to himself while clenching his fists tight, “Lán Zhàn is worried about me. I must not die!”</p>
        <p>He suddenly smiled.</p>
        <p>His smile was so bright that it eclipsed the sun.</p>
        <p>And, for a split second, it seemed to Lán WàngJī that he once more saw the invincible opponent in the battle of Jiānglíng, when thousands of Wēn sect’s cultivators had surrounded him However, none of them could get close to him.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was standing in the middle of the fierce* corpses, which were under his command. His untied hair was fluttering in the wind. And, the melodious sound of his flute was like played by a celestial being.</p>
        <small>*The term ‘fierce’ is used to describe a corpse with a strong resentment, hence the corpse is invincible.</small>
        <p>Back then, Wèi WúXiàn had the same smile on his face, arrogantly glancing at his opponents, looking down upon the world, everything was under his control.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn boldly said, “So what if you’ll soon turn into a fully fledged dragon. Who do you think you are to make Lán Zhàn feel so sad.”</p>
        <p>In an instant, there was a very warm sensation in his abdomen, then his whole body was filled with vigorous spiritual power.</p>
        <p>The red light of Suíbiàn became brighter, and, like a shooting star, Suíbiàn dashed towards the bank, covering several yards in the blink of an eye.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī, who had also rushed towards him, hugged Wèi WúXiàn in the air, holding him tight, he flew to the bank.</p>
        <p>The young dragon didn’t chase after them. It just hovered over the pond, quietly watching them, the mortal beings, while exhaling white fumes through its nostrils.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn stood side by side on the bank, fearlessly looking at the young dragon, and defiantly pointing their swords towards it.</p>
        <p>After a little while, it appeared as though the young dragon felt that fighting with those humans was beneath its dignity. It disdainfully wagged its tail, then flew away.</p>
        <p>As soon as the young dragon had gone, dark clouds began to appear in the sky. In the next instant, the sky was completely covered with the rolling gloomy clouds.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, lightning streaked through the clouds, soon followed by a loud sound of the thunder. And then, a heavy rain abruptly began to pour down.</p>
        <p>In no time, they were all drenched to the skin.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s wet fringe stuck on his forehead, while rainwater was sliding down his cheeks.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn.” he called, turning his head towards Lán WàngJī, and was instantly shocked to see the white parts of Lán WàngJī’s eyes had turned red. It was a terrible sight.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s heart was in pain. He then smiled, and said; “I was really scared. So, hurry up and soothe m––”</p>
        <p>He hadn’t even finished his sentence that Lán WàngJī abruptly pulled him into his arms, and covered his mouth in a deep kiss.</p>
        <p>The sandalwood fragrance of Lán WàngJī also wrapped around Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was so fervently kissed that he felt his whole body becoming feeble. Furthermore, Lán WàngJī was holding him so tight that his upper body began to hurt.</p>
        <p>Putting his hands against Lán WàngJī’s chest, Wèi WúXiàn tried his best to break free. Then, gasping for breath, he said, “Wait! We are in front of kids...”</p>
        <p>Paying no heed to Wèi WúXiàn’s attempt, Lán WàngJī put one hand on the back of Wèi WúXiàn’s head, and vigorously pulled him back into his arms, while his other hand clapped on Wèi WúXiàn’s buttocks firmly, he turned around.</p>
        <p>With his back, Lán WàngJī put Wèi WúXiàn out of sight of the teenagers, who were so shocked that their jaws dropped open.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn moaned in pain. However, this time, he didn’t dare to struggle. Instead, he submissively wrapped his arms around Lán WàngJī’s neck, and let him give vent to his distress.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī’s kisses were like a tornado, causing havoc wherever it passed. Biting Wèi WúXiàn’s lower lip as though he wanted to tear it off. Sucking his tongue to the point that Wèi WúXiàn began to feel the base of his tongue going numb.</p>
        <p>Gradually, Wèi WúXiàn was getting close to losing his consciousness. His arms began to slide down from Lán WàngJī’s neck. And, before he could pass out, Lán WàngJī finally let go of his mouth.</p>
        <p>Still holding Wèi WúXiàn tight, Lán WàngJī let him rest his head on his chest, while turning his own head, and quietly looking at the teenagers. His ears became red with embarrassment.</p>
        <p>At the moment they saw Lán WàngJī turning his head towards them, some YúnmèngJiāng sect’s disciples hurriedly turned around to avoid eye contact. Lán SīZhuī blindfolded Lán JǐngYí with his hands, while closing his own eyes tight.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn pressed his forehead against Lán WàngJī’s chin, wrapped his arms around him, and gave him a few pats on the back to comfort him.</p>
        <p>They peacefully hugged each other for a while.</p>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn slightly raised his head, and pecked Lán WàngJī on the cheek. He tenderly said, “Lán Zhàn, I formed a golden core*.”</p>
        <small>*Golden core is the source of the spiritual energy.</small>

        <br />
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, this is not a normal rain.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Uh-huh.” agreed Lán WàngJī. He then looked far into the distance, observing the endless dark clouds that covered the whole city, the torrential rain that poured like hell, and the strong wind that roared like a tiger.</p>
        <p>Soon after, a firework signal in the shape of nine petals of the lotus flower flickered in the air. This firework signal belonged to YúnmèngJiāng sect.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Someone from YúnmèngJiāng clan will come this way. Let’s wait here for whoever will arrive, so, together, we can discuss what to do next.”</p>
        <p>The area in which they were presently was the region of Yúnmèng, a territory that was under the jurisdiction of the YúnmèngJiāng sect. Therefore, they could not handle this rain issue without their permission.</p>
        <p>After a while, a cultivator dressed in purple arrived on his sword, looking exhausted; a sign that indicated that something must have happened. His name was Jiāng Yuán, and was stationed at the local post tower.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was inwardly surprised that there was a post tower of Lotus Piers nearby.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Yuán bowed to Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn, then said, “This rainstorm is so violent that it has caused flash floods in many places in the downstream areas of Han River.</p>
        <p>“Furthermore, water ghouls have taken advantage of the flooding to attack people.</p>
        <p>“The leader has already sent our people to every embankment’s location, so to protect them from bursting under pressure of water.</p>
        <p>“Right now, however, there is a shortage of manpower, so the leader has dispatched a request for assistance to LánlíngJīn, GūsūLán and QīnghéNiè clans.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn inwardly said, “Jiāng Chéng* has always been arrogant and aloof. For him to swallow his pride and ask for help to other clans surely shows that the situation must be extremely serious, that lives of common people are at stake.”</p>
        <small>*Jiāng Chéng is the name of the leader of the YúnmèngJiāng sect.</small>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Where is Leader Jiāng as we speak?”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Yuán replied, “The leader is in charge of protecting the Shiyan embankment.”</p>
        <p>The embankment of Shiyan was built where the width of Han River was the most narrow, and also it was mostly likely to be damaged by the floods. Since Jiāng Chéng was personally supervising the operation there, this was another sign that the situation of the lower reaches of Han River must be critical.</p>
        <p>During all this time, eyes filled with tears, Yú XiǎoShān was inwardly blaming himself, unable to utter a single word.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn, who was briefly informed of what happened in the pond, patted him on the shoulder, and said, “In the recent years, there has been many floods occurring in Yúnmèng. Now, it’s clear that they were caused by that young dragon.</p>
        <p>“It has also altered the spiritual energy of the earth and water, causing the monsters and evil spirits to appear more frequently.</p>
        <p>“But now that the young dragon has gone, this heavy rain won’t last more than three days, and all these issues will be resolved at once. There might be a favourable weather for a decade to come.”</p>
        <p>Yú XiǎoShān was still young after all, and could no longer hold back his tears. He started to cry. Then, he felt embarrassed, and wiped away his tears. While choking back the tears, he called  “Wèi qiánbèi...”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled, then adjusted the collar of Yú XiǎoShān’s school uniform, and said, “It’s all right. Who has ever done a few reckless things when they were young. I was much more of a fool than you back then. Cheer up!”</p>
        <p>The other teenagers from YúnmèngJiāng sect gathered around Wèi WúXiàn, then, in a low voice and in a discordant manner, they called, “Wèi qiánbèi.”</p>
        <p>One by one, Wèi WúXiàn fondled the top of their heads. Then, he addressed to everyone, “Right now, we cannot any longer return to Lotus Piers by boat.</p>
        <p>“Since this place is where the young dragon cultivated itself, SīZhuī and JǐngYí, both of you will stay here along with the rest of GūsūLán disciples, in case something else happens.</p>
        <p>“As for the disciples of YúnmèngJiāng sect, who are more familiar with this area, come along with us. HánGuāng-Jūn* and I are going to Shiyan embankment to join Leader Jiāng. On our way there, we will fly over Han River in order to inspect the level of the river.”</p>
        <small>*HánGuāng-Jūn is the honorific title of Lán WàngJī.</small>
        <p>“Yes, sir!” agreed everyone.</p>
        <br />
        <p>... ... ...</p>
        <br />
        <p>Lán WàngJī had taken Wèi WúXiàn to ride on his sword.</p>
        <p>Wrapping his arms around Lán WàngJī’s waist, and while fiddling with Lán WàngJī’s waist pendant, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Second Brother*, you will be tired. Let me ride on my own sword.”</p>
        <small>*Second Brother (二哥哥, èr-gēge) is referred to the second child of a family.</small>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “You just formed your golden core. So, for the time being, you should not use your spiritual power.”</p>
        <p>He then held Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, and added, “When we arrive at Shiyan embankment, you’ll need to meditate in order to stabilise your golden core.”</p>
        <p>Flying through the strong storm that caused them to move much slower than usual, they all had wrapped their whole bodies with a waterproof spell.</p>
        <p>Beneath, the river was raging; they could observe a sharp increase in the level of water, and also, in many places, the river had already overflown the embankments.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Lán WàngJī stopped Bìchén*. Pointing towards a location, he asked, “What is that?”</p>
        <small>*Bìchén is the name of Lán WàngJī’s sword.</small>
        <p>Everyone looked in the direction he had pointed his finger, and saw a huge hole on the ground that was surrounded by a woodland with an abundant vegetation.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Yuán replied, “That is Ganlin Reservoir. It was built under the reign of the previous dynasty. It is now abandoned.</p>
        <p>“In the last years of the previous dynasty, the downstream areas of Han River were occupied by the army of the current dynasty.</p>
        <p>“In order to crush the enemy, the emperor of the previous dynasty personally order to construct a dam, so that when the flood happened, the overflow of water would be stored in that reservoir, and, later on, to be released in order to inundate the downstream areas.</p>
        <p>“In the year the dam was built, there was a high flood peak. However, when the flood occurred, water failed to go towards Ganlin Reservoir. Instead, it diverted to Ankang River.</p>
        <p>“Ankang City is nearby, and the width of its river is unfortunately much narrow, and, as a result, the Ankang embankment burst under pressure, and the city was flooded.</p>
        <p>“The flood had caused a lot of casualties in the downstream areas of Ankang River, which in turn had caused common people to harbour a grievance against their own emperor.</p>
        <p>“Few years after that incident, the previous dynasty was exterminated by the current dynasty.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Is it be possible to divert the overflow of water to that reservoir, if we blow up the dam?”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Yuán replied, “Yes, it is possible. However, at the end of the previous dynasty, people started to live near the reservoir.</p>
        <p>“As you can see, this area is fertile, and the crop yields are high. So, more and more people have come here to settle. And, up to the present time, that area turns into a village of about a hundred households.</p>
        <p>“If the dam is blown up, the village will be submerged.</p>
        <p>“In fact, people are not supposed to live in that location. Although the imperial officials came multiple times to persuade them to move out, the villagers are reluctant to leave the land they are attached to.</p>
        <p>“The leader also came to persuade them, but they still haven’t changed their mind.</p>
        <p>“In recent years, there have been some minor floods occurring in their village, but nothing serious has ever happened. So, year after year, their relocation process has been put off.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “The young dragon that had concealed itself inside the pond has caused changes in the weather conditions. That’s why we have this unusual heavy rain.</p>
        <p>“So, this time, the disaster will happen and very soon. Those villagers must leave the village without delay.</p>
        <p>“If you have the decree of your sect with you, go and ask the imperial officials to come to the village. We’ll wait for you there.”</p>
        <p>Then, he talked to Lán WàngJī, “Lán Zhàn, let’s go to the village.”</p>
        <p>“Okay.” agreed Lán WàngJī, then he set Bìchén in motion and flew towards the village, along with the rest of YúnmèngJiāng disciples.</p>
        <br />
        <p>... ... ...</p>
        <br />
        <p>Wěishàn was the name of the village, and the negotiation began as soon as the imperial officials arrived.</p>
        <p>“HánGuāng-Jūn, even though you are highly regarded in the elite society, you should not trouble yourself with our mundane matters.</p>
        <p>“We have been living in this village for four or five generations. Are you really expecting us to move out just because you told us to do so?” said the village chief arrogantly, banging his walking stick on the floor as he uttered his last words.</p>
        <p>“No way!” objected the rest of the villagers.</p>
        <p>“We can’t just leave, and abandon our homes.” voiced a villager.</p>
        <p>The drill instructor in charge of the relocation process stepped in, “Every year, in spring, the prefect issues a relocation order for you to move out.</p>
        <p>“This year, because the warlock predicted changes in meteorological phenomena, the prefect has issued three consecutive emergency orders. And yet, you still refuse to be relocated.</p>
        <p>“You are living in a land which is lower than the level of the river. Are you not afraid?</p>
        <p>“I know that you have already packed your belongings, but you refuse to cooperate, unless someone gets tough on you. Am I right?”</p>
        <p>After a short pause, the drill instructor resumed, “The compensation has already been assessed. Right now, you are taking the advantage of this emergency to increase the amount of the compensation.”</p>
        <p>Persuading those people to move out from their village had always been a hassle. Upon seeing the decree of the YúnmèngJiāng sect, the authorities had mobilised nearly a hundred officials to assist in relocating the villagers.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī reiterated, “As I have already said, I promise you that GūsūLán will pay for your looses, if the authorities fail to compensate you in time.”</p>
        <p>The village chief reacted, “I don’t believe in your promise, because you people from the privileged sects are the most deceitful mankind. When the time comes, neither your sect nor the authorities will easily accept to compensate us.”</p>
        <p>Another villager put forward, “We have never experienced any disaster despite the heavy rains that pour down every year. So, we won’t leave!”</p>
        <p>Then, one after another, the villagers started to raise their voice, behaving as though the imminent threat was none of their concern.</p>
        <p>Time was running out, and, standing behind Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn could not take it any longer. He approached the drill instructor, and, in deep voice, he asked, “Mr Zhāng, is it true that the compensation has already been assessed?”</p>
        <p>The drill instructor replied, “Yes, it’s true. The village chief saw it, and sighed it. However, the nine members of the village committee have not signed it yet.”</p>
        <p>He then took out a stack of copies from his sleeve, and handed it over to Lán WàngJī. He added, “As a matter of fact, the villagers are ready to be relocated. They are just waiting for the compensation to be paid.”</p>
        <p>For a while, the drill instructor cast a look at the villagers, then he said, “Earlier, when I inspected the village, I noticed that you have already packed your belongings.”</p>
        <p>The villagers appeared to be indifferent to what the drill instructor had just said, wearing a disdainful look on their faces.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Very well.”</p>
        <p>He then pulled off Chénqíng* from his waist belt, and carelessly began to tap on the palm of his another hand with his flute.</p>
        <small>*Chénqíng is the name of Wèi WúXiàn’s flute.</small>
        <p>A rictus appeared on the corner of his mouth, he asked, “By the way, have you ever heard of Yílíng Lǎozǔ*?”</p>
        <small>*Yílíng Lǎozǔ is the honorific title of Wèi WúXiàn.</small>
        <p>The village chief suddenly turned pale, saying inwardly, “Rumour has it that Yílíng Lǎozǔ and HánGuāng-Jūn got married, and become an inseparable couple. Could it be that this handsome young man is Yílíng Lǎozǔ?”</p>
        <p>These villagers had never seen Yílíng Lǎozǔ. However, they had heard about his prowess during the Shooting Sun campaign, his hostility on Qióngqí Path and his atrocities at Nightless Sky City. They all had shuddered with horror listening to the vicious methods of Yílíng Lǎozǔ.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn slowly turned his flute so that everyone could see the scarlet tassel that was dangling from one end of Chénqíng; the scarlet tassel was one of  Yílíng Lǎozǔ’s signatures.</p>
        <p>He then smiled, and said, “I am Yílíng Lǎozǔ, also known as Wèi WúXiàn.”</p>
        <p>As soon as he finished presenting himself, Wèi WúXiàn brought Chénqíng to his lower lip, and, at leisure, he blew a few notes.</p>
        <p>All of a sudden, they started to hear some terrifying roars coming from outside. It seemed like the assembly hall was surrounded by fierce corpses.</p>
        <p>As one would expect, the villagers got really frightened that they were no longer able to make noises.</p>
        <p>Still, it was hard to believe that the vicious Yílíng Lǎozǔ was this fair-skinned and elegant young man.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <br />
        <p>So as to convince whoever might doubt that he was Yílíng Lǎozǔ, Wèi WúXiàn walked to the front of the hall, and slowly sat down on one of the main chairs.</p>
        <p>He then snapped his fingers, and, the very next instant, the villagers gasped in horror; a long-haired and faceless female demon in red appeared next to Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Using his flute, Wèi WúXiàn began to stir up the demon’s hair, which had an effect of stimulating the demon’s hostility. The sight of the faceless demon became extremely frightening.</p>
        <p>Casting a sideways glance at the villagers, and in a gentle tone, yet, a tone full of threats, Wèi WúXiàn said, “I’ve run out of patience. You have until before the nightfall to leave the village. Whoever stays beyond that limit will be turned into a fierce corpse.”</p>
        <p>The terrifying Yílíng Lǎozǔ, who showed no sympathy to anyone, who just by mentioning his name made children stop crying at night, instantly made those reluctant villagers get going.</p>
        <p>There were nearly a hundred officers sent in order to assist in relocation of the villagers, and those officers brought along many horses and carts. Moreover, there were enough young adults in the village to give a hand. So, the evacuation would not be a major problem.</p>
        <p>“Mr Zhāng, now it’s down to you and your men to deal with the relocation.” said Wèi WúXiàn, “HánGuāng-Jūn and I are going to blow up the dam.”</p>
        <p>The drill instructor repeatedly said ‘yes’, while being on his guard. Apparently, the villagers were not the only ones being scared by Yílíng Lǎozǔ.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was used to that kind of reaction. He humbly smiled to himself. What he wanted to do right now was to leave as soon as possible along with Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>However, at that precise moment, someone among the last few of the villagers to leave the hall suddenly stepped forward, and rudely said, “Wèi WúXiàn, you evil heretic! You’re still as insolent as ever!”</p>
        <p>That person turned out to be Fāng MèngChén*. Furthermore, this village was not only his grandmother’s homeland, but also the place where he had been living in seclusion.</p>
        <small>*Fāng MèngChén lost his parents during the Nightless Sky City bloodbath. When he got the chance to avenge their deaths, a turn of events happened, and he was instead saved by Wèi WúXiàn.</small>
        <p>“HánGuāng-Jūn, Wèi WúXiàn’s evil nature has not changed. And yet, you condone his villainy.” carried on Fāng MèngChén in a resentful way.</p>
        <p>Once there is a feeling of hatred in someone’s heart, lies and slanders are bound to be spread around, and people love to listen to the incredible and sensational rumours. Why should one bother about it? The truth never gets people excited, so it is easily ignored.</p>
        <p>The drill instructor did not at all intervene. Relocating a village, no matter how much the compensation was provided, always caused villagers to hold grudges against the authorities.</p>
        <p>Over the past ten years, three local prefects had taken office one after another. However, none of them had ever dared to tackle this relocation issue.</p>
        <p>Every time something happened that required to relocate them, if the villagers insisted on staying, the authorities had no other alternative but to give up.</p>
        <p>Now that Yílíng Lǎozǔ took on this burdensome task, the authorities had surely taken this advantage to get rid of this relocation process. However, the drill instructor didn’t go into that detail when he explained the matter to Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Outside, the torrential rain kept on pouring. And, right now, it was a race against time to get all the villagers out of the village before the nightfall.</p>
        <p>The early yelling of the villagers had caused Wèi WúXiàn’s head to spin. He knew that there were people who had their own mindset, and trying to reason with them would be just a waste of time. Therefore, he didn’t feel like justifying himself.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn made a gesture to stop Lán WàngJī who was about to intervene, and simply said, “You knew straight away what kind of villain I am. So, why are you still here?”</p>
        <p>He then unsheathed Suíbiàn, pointed the sword towards Fāng MèngChén, and asked, “Can you beat me?” Fāng MèngChén immediately froze in fear. Then, he added, “ If you can’t, then shut up, and go help others to move out.”</p>
        <p>Fāng MèngChén’s face was filled with indignation. He then pointed his finger at Wèi WúXiàn, “You..., you...”</p>
        <p>The faceless demon turned its head, and “looked” at Fāng MèngChén, as though she was threatening him.</p>
        <p>As a result, Fāng MèngChén was no longer able to utter whatever the verbal abuse he was about to. He lifted his robes, walked towards the exit, and slammed the door as he left the hall.</p>
        <p>Still holding Chénqíng in his hand, Wèi WúXiàn waved at the female demon, and the latter disappeared. He hen thundered at the rest of villagers, “Why are you still here! Come on, get moving!”</p>
        <p>The villagers immediately dispersed, returning to their homes to get ready to leave the village.</p>
        <p>Then, the drill instructor saluted Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn with his hands brought in of him, making one into a fist while the other covered the fist. He then left the assembly hall with his men.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn sent Jiāng Yuán along with the rest of the YúnmèngJiāng disciples to assist the villagers with their relocation.</p>
        <p>Right now, the only people remained inside the hall were Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng...” Lán WàngJī held Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, feeling extremely frustrated for not being able to defend him. He wanted to say something, but he felt that his words would not convey his feelings. Besides, he knew that he was not good at expressing himself.</p>
        <p>Seeing that his sweetheart was longing to say something but unable to utter a single word, Wèi WúXiàn put an end to his struggle by placing Chénqíng over Lán WàngJī’s lips.</p>
        <p>He then said, while smiling, “HánGuāng-Jūn, you’re such an angel. You always stand by my side. Cheer up! Don’t be so sad. I don’t care what other people think of me. I only care about you, and how you see me.”</p>
        <p>He wrapped his arms around Lán WàngJī’s waist. His gaze became flirtatious, and his voice coquettish, “So, keep on pampering me, and never leave me.”</p>
        <p>He then stood on tiptoe, leaned close to Lán WàngJī’s white jade colour-like ear, softly blew into the ear, and said, “You are mine.”</p>
        <p>As soon as he heard those words, Lán WàngJī held Wèi WúXiàn tight into his arms, and earnestly said, “You are mine, too.”</p>
        <p>What is right and what is wrong are judged by oneself. One’s reputation is judged by others. One’s gains and losses are at the mercy of their quantity.</p>
        <p>For Lán WàngJī, his Wèi Yīng was still the same, despite many hardships he had gone through.</p>
        <br />
        <p>... ... ...</p>
        <br />
        <p>Located ten miles away from Wěishàn Village, the dam stood tall and majestic, on the top, five carts could drive abreast, and its outer walls were coated with iron, making the dam very resistant and solid.</p>
        <p>Spiritual powers were primarily used to slay evil spirits, demons and monsters. Since all things in this world had their own laws and principles, cultivators’ powers turned out to be very limited in dealing with the mundane things.</p>
        <p>So, destroying this robust dam in a very short period of time, even for someone with high spiritual power like Lán WàngJī, would take a lot of efforts to succeed.</p>
        <p>In the pouring rain, Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn carefully selected the appropriate positions for the detonation. Then, they wrapped each blasting talisman with a waterproof spell, and then, placed them on the selected positions.</p>
        <p>The blasting talismans were emitting a clear blue light through the rain. However, from a distance, the emitted blue light grew dimmer.</p>
        <p>Those talismans, however, would be activated only after all villagers had reached the main road, which was located near the mountains. Then, Lán WàngJī would use his spiritual power to strike on the holes that would be made with the blasting talismans.</p>
        <p>The night would fall in less than two hours. Meanwhile, Lán WàngJī gave Wèi WúXiàn some assorted rice balls, and regretfully said, “I didn’t bring enough food to eat, because I didn’t expect this turn of events.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn leaned his head on Lán WàngJī’s shoulder. Licking his fingers after he had eaten a rice ball, he said, “Second Brother, it was delicious. What did you put inside? Was it a plum? It was soft with a little bit of the sour taste. You’re so wonderful.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī’s lips curved into a smile. He wrapped one arm around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist, and put the palm of his other hand on Wèi WúXiàn’s abdomen, where the lower Dantian was located. He could feel the undulation of the spiritual power, which was much different than before.</p>
        <p>He said, “Wèi Yīng, you formed your golden core just few hours ago, so, you should get some rest. ”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “I’ll sleep for a while, then. Wake me up when Jiāng Yuán sends us a message.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Okay.” Then, sitting on a rock, he extended the layer of his waterproof spell, and then, he carried Wèi WúXiàn on his lap, letting him rest on his arms.</p>
        <p>The heavy rain was pouring like a towering waterfall, under the dark and gloomy clouds, the blue sky was high and out of sight. However, they cared less about this dreadful weather, since they had each other, and nothing else mattered to them.</p>
        <p>With the exception of the rainstorm and river sounds, everything was completely silent. It seemed as though they were the only ones left in this vast world.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn formed his golden core at a critical moment. Then, for half a day, he had been rushing around, which made his golden core’s vessel become unstable. Right now, he felt extremely tired, he closed his eyes, and, in a low voice, he said, “Lán Zhàn, sing a song to lull me to sleep.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī tenderly kissed Wèi WúXiàn on the forehead, then he softly began to hum WàngXiàn, a song that he composed for both of them. Soon after, Wèi WúXiàn fell into a deep sleep.</p>
        <br />
        <p>... ... ...</p>
        <br />
        <p>“Wèi Yīng... Wèi Yīng... wake up.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn woke up from his sleep as he heard Lán WàngJī’s voice calling him. He somehow felt that he didn’t rest long enough. As was his habit, each time Lán WàngJī woke him up, Wèi WúXiàn would hug him and peck him on the cheek four or five times.</p>
        <p>With his fingers, Lán WàngJī gently combed Wèi WúXiàn’s long hair, then, he adjusted his ponytail, and said, “Jiāng Yuán sent the message saying that they all have reached the main road.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Let’s begin, then.”</p>
        <p>In the torrential rain, Lán WàngJī summoned WàngJī*, while Wèi WúXiàn invoked spirits. Then, together, they activated all the blasting talismans.</p>
        <small>*The guqin of Lán WàngJī is named after his owner: WàngJī.</small>
        <p>The sound of the detonation roared loudly, several large holes could be seen at the bottom of the dam. However, the dam was too solid, the blasting talismans couldn’t blow through its walls.</p>
        <p>Using his guqin, Lán WàngJī began to strike with all his strength, sending WàngJī’s ice-blue spiritual notes at the bottom of the dam, and, little by little, expanding and deepening the holes that were previously made with the blasting talismans.</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī continued to consume his spiritual power, Wèi WúXiàn felt uneasy watching him exhausting himself.</p>
        <p>He said, “Lán Zhàn, this won’t do. I will go to Ankang River and find where the width of the river is the most narrow, then build a barrier with fierce corpses.</p>
        <p>“When the current won’t any longer carry on downstream, it will flow back and diverge here. You will then gather the force of that current to destroy the dam. ”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī immediately said, “No! You are not going anywhere, because your golden core is still fragile.” He then realised that the tone of his voice was a little bit harsh, and, inwardly, he regretted it.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn reassured him, “Don’t worry, I won’t use too much of my spiritual power. I will mostly use my demonic power.”</p>
        <p>He then took out from his sleeve two signal-transfer talismans. He stuck one on Lán WàngJī’s chest, and stuck the other within his clothes, at his chest level.</p>
        <p>He said, “If you succeed in blowing up the dam, use this signal-transfer talisman to let me know. Once, I receive the signal, I’ll come back here straight away.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you must be careful, don’t do anything reckless. If you start to feel poorly, notify me immediately.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn summoned Suíbiàn, then stepped on it. He leaned forward and kissed Lán WàngJī, he then said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, I’m afraid that we won’t have time to make love tonight. Since that will be the case, remember to make it up to me next time.”</p>
    </div>

        <br />
        <p>First of all, Wèi WúXiàn flew back to Wěishàn Village, and observed that it was completely empty, not even a single farm animal was left behind.</p>
        <p>Like the drill instructor mentioned earlier that the villagers had already packed their belongings, which, fortunately, made the evacuation to be done much faster.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then proceeded on what brought him here by blowing on Chénqíng so as to summon a large numbers of fierce corpses from the graveyard of the village.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, he began to hear some cries, which were undoubtedly made by a baby.</p>
        <p>Guided by the cries, Wèi WúXiàn found a baby girl, around three months old, inside of one of the empty houses.</p>
        <p>Favouring boys over girls was the only reason that came into Wèi WúXiàn’s mind to explain why the parents of this baby heartlessly abandon their own daughter.</p>
        <p>On a table, Wèi WúXiàn noticed a jar of milk, and, by the smell, he determined that it was from a sheep. Leaving this milk was probably the parents’ wish to ease the soul of the baby after death.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn found it rather ironic to care for the soul of the baby rather than the baby herself, letting out a heavy sigh of despair.</p>
        <p>He then took a sip of sheep milk in order to ensure its freshness, and quickly warmed it up with his spiritual power. Using a wooden spoon, also found on the table, he began to feed the baby.</p>
        <p>However, not only the little baby girl was not familiar with Wèi WúXiàn’s scent, but also she was neither accustomed to the taste of sheep milk, nor was she used to be fed with a spoon. All of this caused her to cry even louder, wanting to be held and breastfed by her mother.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn tried to soothe the crying baby, first by swinging side to side while holding her, then by gently stroking her back, and then by humming some nursery rhymes. However, none of these methods worked.</p>
        <p>In the end, the baby got really hungry that she finally let Wèi WúXiàn feed her.</p>
        <p>When he was a teenager, Wèi WúXiàn had taken care of his juniors of around six years old. However, he had never looked after a baby before.</p>
        <p>So, for fear that he would choke the little baby, Wèi WúXiàn took extra care to fed her. And, after he finished spoon-feeding her, the baby, tired from crying so much, fell deeply asleep.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then became concerned with the amount of time that took him to deal with the baby.</p>
        <p>Without further delay, he took the baby’s blanket and wrapped the little baby, then, holding the baby, he secured the blanket firmly around his torso like a baby wrap carrier, and was ready to go. </p>
        <p>Before leaving the house, Wèi WúXiàn put back the waterproof spell that he had removed when he entered into the house, then he flew towards Ankang River, giving orders to the fierce corpses to follow along.</p>
        <p>Remembering what Jiāng Yuán said about the Ankang embankment, which was burst by the flood under the reign of the previous dynasty, Wèi WúXiàn intended to build the barrier of fierce corpses at that precise location.</p>
        <p>If his assumption was correct, the embankment must have been built where the width of the river was the most narrow, which was what he wanted.</p>
        <p>The night had fallen in this dreadful rain, so, Wèi WúXiàn took out few fire-talismans from his sleeve, and ignited them so as to light his way to Ankang River.</p>
        <p>Also illuminated by the talismans, Han River beneath was still turbulent, and the level of the water kept on increasing.</p>
        <p>Upon reaching Ankang River, Wèi WúXiàn easily spotted the location of his interest, since the embankment had never been repaired, and, furthermore, at that spot, the current ran much faster.</p>
        <p>He pulled off Chénqíng, brought it to his lips, but, all the sudden, he paused, appeared to have forgotten something.</p>
        <p>He put his flute back on his waist belt, unshielded Suíbiàn, and cut two small and clean pieces of his gown, then, carefully, he plugged the baby’s ears with the two pieces of cloth.</p>
        <p>The little baby was still sleeping soundly, putting her tiny little hands on Wèi WúXiàn’s chest.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn noticed it, and the whole scene brought a warm smile on his face.</p>
        <p>He then prodded her gently on the cheek, and said, “Young girl, wait that I finish my work here, then I will take you to see my HánGuāng-Jūn. He is the most handsome man in the world. You’re definitely going to like him.”</p>
        <p>Then, he pulled off Chénqíng, and began to blow some notes. In response to the sound of the flute, the fierce corpses from Wěishàn Village’s graveyard jumped into the river.</p>
        <p>From the riverbed and across the river, a tall wall of fierce corpses was formed, then, countless of water ghouls emerged from water, and scrambled up to fill the gaps between fierce corpses.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn intensified the sound of his flute, which cut through the darkness of the night, spread across the surroundings, and resounded through the sky.</p>
        <p>Soon after, more water ghouls came over, and quickly placed themselves on the remnants of the embankment so as to rebuild a new one.</p>
        <p>Ever since Wèi WúXiàn had returned from death, this was the first time he used his demonic power on such a large scale.</p>
        <p>In this heavy rain, the barrier of fierce corpses and water ghouls was completed, and the Ankang embankment was temporarily repaired with water ghouls. </p>
        <p>The downstream flow of water progressively dropped, while, on the other side of the barrier, the coming waves hit violently the newly erected barrier.</p>
        <p>At this rate, the barrier would not withstand the pressure much longer, so, Wèi WúXiàn summoned more corpses from far to reinforce the barrier.</p>
        <p>However, it was not an easy task to overcome the force of nature, even for Yílíng Lǎozǔ, the founder of demonic cultivation.</p>
        <p>At that instance, he felt a violent swing in his golden core vessel, immediately followed by a sharp pain as though his abdomen was ripped open.</p>
        <p>“Oh gosh!” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, “I haven’t had the time to reconcile my newly formed golden core with my demonic power. Right now, the two opposite powers are clashing with each other.”</p>
        <p>Ever since he had been living with Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn had rarely used his demonic power.</p>
        <p>However, right now, not only he overused it, but also the existence of the freshly formed golden core made the situation to be more alarming. So, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t dare to be reckless. Besides, he had promised Lán WàngJī that he would be careful.</p>
        <p>The last thing to be done was to use talismans to stabilise the barrier that he had just finished building, then, with the baby girl, he would rejoin Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>However, all the remains of talismans in his possession were all marked with ‘blasting’ character on them; no more blank talismans left to be used for the barrier.</p>
        <p>This inconvenience, however, didn’t stop him from carrying out his last task. He stepped on Suíbiàn, then got close to the barrier, and, up there, he cut his fingers with his sword, and then, using his blood, Wèi WúXiàn began to draw a series of characters on the barrier.</p>
        <p>After he had finished marking the whole barrier, a bright red light shone from it like a wildfire blazing across the woods.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, however, the pain in his golden core vessel had progressively increased. Now, it became unbearable.</p>
        <p>“It’s done.” said to himself. Then, all of a sudden, he got dizzy, and, with the extreme pain in his abdomen, he was no longer able to stand on his sword, and fell on his butt along with his sword on the riverbed presently exhibited.</p>
        <p>Using Suíbiàn as a support, and not allowing the silt to dirty the baby’s blanket, Wèi WúXiàn managed to stand up.</p>
        <p>Then, he said, “This dizziness is caused by my using too much blood. I’m afraid that this time I have to drink the GūsūLán bitter decoction without complaint.”</p>
        <p>At that precise moment, he felt a murderous aura, and, since he had been on the battlefields, facing death countless times, instinctively, Wèi WúXiàn dodged while protecting the baby.</p>
        <p>The very next instant of him avoiding the unknown danger, a flash of energy of a sword whizzed past him.</p>
        <p>A corner of his sleeve was torn off by the energy of that sword. Furthermore, the ripped cloth was sliced into small pieces, flew a few yards away, and landed scattered on the mud of the riverbed.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then turned his head towards where the attack came from, and, to his astonishment, he saw Fāng MèngChén.</p>
        <p>Fāng MèngChén had left Wěishàn Village along with the rest of the villagers. However, soon after they had reached the main road, a quarrel broke out between the villagers and the youngsters of the YúnmèngJiāng sect.</p>
        <p>Soon, the scene became chaotic, and, taking advantage of the conflict, Fāng MèngChén sneaked away with his sword, and flew back to the village. Just as he approached the village, he saw Wèi WúXiàn, who carried a baby, flew towards Ankang City, followed by fierce corpses.</p>
        <p>“So, it’s you, who furtively attacked me.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Yes, it’s me. Are you surprised to see me?” uttered Fāng MèngChén with a face full of hatred. “I’m here to put an end to your despicable existence.” he added.</p>
        <p>After secretly following Wèi WúXiàn, Fāng MèngChén had hidden himself inside the dense woods on one side of the river, waiting for Wèi WúXiàn to exhaust himself, as well as using up all his spiritual power.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for Wèi WúXiàn, there were no more corpses or water ghouls in a radius of several miles that he could summon to fight against Fāng MèngChén.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, he could not afford to break the spell of the talismans, and use the fierce corpses that were holding the water of the river back, or use the ghouls that formed the embankment as a flood prevention.</p>
        <p>So, bearing the severe pain in his abdomen, Wèi WúXiàn held Suíbiàn on one hand, and shielded the baby with the other hand, he fought and exchanged several attacks with Fāng MèngChén.</p>
        <p>For some time, they attacked each other with their spiritual powers without interruption.</p>
        <p>Then, as it was advisable for him not to use too much of his spiritual power, came an acute sensation from his abdomen. At that instance, Wèi WúXiàn sensed that some cracks were formed in his golden core, similar to those in a crystal ball.</p>
        <p>Trying hard to stand firm on his feet while concealing any flaws, Wèi WúXiàn said, “You are here to avenge the death of your parents, however, your revenge has nothing to do with this baby. So, let me put her on the riverbank.” </p>
        <p>Fāng MèngChén snorted, and said sharply, “Why should I spare the life of your evil child?”</p>
        <p>Irritated, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Are you mad? This baby is not my child.”</p>
        <p>Being as stubborn as a mule, Fāng MèngChén uttered, “If the child is not yours, then why are you protecting her?” As he spoke, Fāng MèngChén gathered a great amount of energy that he transferred to his sword, and struck hard.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn didn’t dare to block the attack. He thrust Suíbiàn into the riverbed, and, with his martial art skills and the support of his sword, he shielded the baby, leaned his body backwards, and avoided the blow.</p>
        <p>Looking like a madman, Fāng MèngChén laughed hideously, and said, “Wèi WúXiàn, are you not always going on the rampage? Why do you keep on dodging my attacks, instead of being violent?”</p>
        <p>As they carried on fighting, on the other side of the barrier of fierce corpses and water ghouls, the sound of the waves were getting louder; the intense waves kept on crashing against the barrier, and shaking the ground beneath them.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, as the time passed by, the red light on the barrier was getting dimmed, as the energy of the talismans progressively weakened.</p>
        <p>Anxious, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Wait for a moment that I fix the barrier.”</p>
        <p>Fāng MèngChén sneered, “There is no use trying to buy time, since today you won’t escape death. So, if the barrier is about to collapse, then let it collapse.”</p>
        <p>Greatly upset, Wèi WúXiàn thundered, “There are common people living downstream!”</p>
        <p>Fāng MèngChén shouted back, “It’s none of my concern!”</p>
    </div>

        <br />
        <p>As a matter of fact, Fāng MèngChén’s spiritual power was not great, nor was his swordsmanship, however, his moves were quick.</p>
        <p>He knew that Wèi WúXiàn was running out of spiritual power, and noted that Wèi WúXiàn was not in a hurry to put an end to this fight, he only spent as less as possible his physical strength.</p>
        <p>Fāng MèngChén also observed that Wèi WúXiàn was doing his best to protect the baby, so, he began to direct his attacks towards Wèi WúXiàn’s chest, aiming at the little baby.</p>
        <p>Sadly, Wèi WúXiàn began to feel dizzy again, and, moreover, it was getting harder for him to handle his sword. Also, the more he used his spiritual power the more the agonising pain in his abdomen increased.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, he could not get close to and attack Fāng MèngChén, because he feared that he would put the little baby in danger of being harmed by Fāng MèngChén.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn knew that he could not hold on forever, so, he decided to take a risk. He moved one step backwards and his foot sank into the mud of the riverbed, and, deceitfully, revealing a flaw.</p>
        <p>As Fāng MèngChén charged once more, Wèi WúXiàn shielded the baby with the energy of his sword.</p>
        <p>However, Fāng MèngChén really took the bait, and, instead of aiming at Wèi WúXiàn’s chest as he formerly intended to do so, he directed his attack towards Wèi WúXiàn’s sunk foot and stabbed his shin.</p>
        <p>This new pain in his leg helped Wèi WúXiàn to clear his head of the dizziness that he was experiencing, and, without losing any moment, Wèi WúXiàn cut off Fāng MèngChén’s arm which was brought within his reach, using his spiritual power that he transferred into Suíbiàn.</p>
        <p>A stream of blood rushed in the air, and, in severe pain, Fāng MèngChén passed out instantly.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then said, “The trick to cutting off arms, I must confess that I learned it from Lán Zhàn.”</p>
        <p>Then, there was a little sound, like the noise of an extinguished fire, coming from Suíbiàn; it had exhausted all its energy.</p>
        <p>The next instance, Wèi WúXiàn sensed the cracks in his golden core widened, then, once more, his head began to spin, and, once again, he fell on his butt on the riverbed.</p>
        <p>At the moment he ended up sitting on the mud, the signal-transfer talisman that he had placed on his chest lit up. The ice-blue light of the talisman began to throb like a heartbeat.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn succeeds!” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, overjoyed.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the sound of the raging waves became more louder, the red light of the talismans went off, and the barrier weakened; it would not resist the pressure much longer.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the fierce corpses and water ghouls at the most top of the barrier began to fall off, resulting in a small stream of water pouring over.</p>
        <p>The stream progressively expanded as corpses and ghouls continued to fall off the barrier, and soon the small stream changed into a waterfall.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was no longer able to stand up as his strength failed him.</p>
        <p>Enduring the pain in his abdomen, he quickly untied the blanket, stuck the signal-transfer talisman on the baby girl, fastened the blanket around Suíbiàn, then he sent Suíbiàn to stick on the trunk of a big tree near the riverbank.</p>
        <p>The small amount of spiritual power that Wèi WúXiàn had transferred into Suíbiàn was enough to cause more pain in his golden core vessel. He could even sense that his golden core was on the verge of shattering.</p>
        <p>Soon after Suíbiàn flew away with the baby, the barrier collapsed completely, and water rushed like a tsunami, the violent waves carried Wèi WúXiàn and Fāng MèngChén on their chaotic course downstream.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, I won’t die.” swore Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>In this turmoil of the river, Wèi WúXiàn managed to use his last bit of spiritual power to protect the vital parts of his body, namely, the head, the neck, the chest and the abdomen, then, he lost his consciousness, engulfed into the darkness.</p>
        <p>The excessive use of his spiritual power had put a lot of strain on his newly formed and still fragile golden core. Like a crystal ball, it eventually broke into small pieces, which scattered and vanished within the golden core vessel.</p>
        <br />
        <p>--- --- ---</p>
        <br />
        <p>“My Lord, although Wèi WúXiàn is infamous, in fact, it is him who forms the bond between GūsūLán and LánlíngJīn sects, as well as the bond between GūsūLán and YúnmèngJiāng sects.</p>
        <p>“GūsūLán has no longer the desire to dwell on the past events related to Wèi WúXiàn. Jīn Líng, the young leader of LánlíngJīn, holds no longer any grudge against Wèi WúXiàn. Even Leader Jiāng, the uncle of the young leader, has changed his attitude towards Wèi WúXiàn; this is due to the attachment between the young leader and Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“In the past, Zéwú-Jūn, the leader of GūsūLán, Jīn GuāngYáo, the former leader of LánlíngJīn, and Chìfēng-zūn, my Lord’s big brother and our former leader, were sworn brothers. Back then, the three of them had formed a strong alliance.</p>
        <p>“Even after our former leader had passed away, Zéwú-Jūn and Jīn GuāngYáo were still treating QīnghéNiè sect very kindly, and giving us their support every time it was needed.</p>
        <p>“At the present time, however, QīnghéNiè has no bond with any other sects, at all.”</p>
        <p>Holding a fan in his hand, Niè HuáiSāng was slowly fanning himself, while quietly listening to his underling.</p>
        <p>The morning sun had not risen yet, and the night sky was not bright, putting a shadow on Niè HuáiSāng’s face, hence making it hard for the underling to see his lord’s expression.</p>
        <p>Two days ago, the news of Wèi WúXiàn, who went missing, came as a great shock among sects.</p>
        <p>Persistently, Lán WàngJī had since played his guqin, invoking and asking spirits the whereabouts of Wèi WúXiàn, until the strings of WàngJī broke off, cutting his fingers in the process. And the guqin was smeared with blood as a result of heavy bleeding.</p>
        <p>In the end, Lán WàngJī had located Wèi WúXiàn’s presence in the vicinity of Baihe, the suburb of Ankang City.</p>
        <p>So, cultivators from the four sects, who had come to assist in flash floods, took turn in searching and throwing nets in the river, day and night.</p>
        <p>Strangely enough, it was QīnghéNiè sect which found Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Unconscious, Wèi WúXiàn was lying on the riverbank of a tributary of the Ankang River.</p>
        <p>The underling resumed, “If Wèi WúXiàn happens to disappear without a trace, HánGuāng-Jūn will be deeply devastated.</p>
        <p>“Zéwú-Jūn has been living in seclusion for many years, so, right now, GūsūLán only relies on HánGuāng-Jūn. However, if HánGuāng-Jūn is lost without Wèi WúXiàn,  GūsūLán will be in an enfeebled state.</p>
        <p>“At the same time, with Wèi WúXiàn being no longer in this world, the connections GūsūLán has with LánlíngJīn and YúnmèngJiāng will be severed.”</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng remained silent, standing close to Wèi WúXiàn, who was still lying on the riverbank, looking ghastly with dark circles under his closed eyes, his lips had turned blue, and, moreover, he was soaking wet.</p>
        <p>Several years had passed since his return from death by the means of being invoked; the summoner offered his body in exchange of having his longing revenge to be done.</p>
        <p>Progressively, the appearance of Mò XuánYǔ, the summoner, had faded away, replaced by Wèi WúXiàn’s own face.</p>
        <p>Back when they were teenagers, and attending the school at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù*, Wèi WúXiàn once said, “The spiritual power is the energy, and the resentment** is also the energy. </p>
        <small>*Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù is the name the residence of the GūsūLán sect.</small>
        <br />
        <small>**Wèi WúXiàn refers to the resentment of a dead who died/got killed in cruelly way.</small>
        <p>“The spiritual power is stored in the golden core vessel, and can be used to split mountains, or be used in various ways for a good cause. So, why the resentment, also being the energy, is forbidden to be used in doing the same things as the spiritual power?”</p>
        <p>The argument that Wèi WúXiàn had put forward shocked everyone present in the classroom, and made Lán Lǎo, the teacher, extremely furious.</p>
        <p>Later on, after school, he said, “I don’t plan on leaving the path to a bright future, and walk on the wrong side of the road. It’s much easier to follow the path that someone else had taken.</p>
        <p>“So, don’t worry about what I have said earlier. I was just answering the questions that Lán Lǎo was asking me.”</p>
        <p>However, few years later, what he had said that it would not happen did happen; Wèi WúXiàn really walked on the wrong side of the road, found himself isolated and doomed.</p>
        <p>Back in that day, when he had been informed that the teacher punished him in copying the GūsūLán rules, Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “I’m not a member of the GūsūLán sect, or planning on becoming one. Why do I have to copy their rules. I won’t do it!”</p>
        <p>However, after his return, he had join the GūsūLán sect, and, with Lán WàngJī, they became a couple who lived in perfect harmony. And, furthermore, he seemed not to mind copying the GūsūLán rules.</p>
        <p>Inside the Guānyīn temple, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Leader Niè, do you know what was inside of this now-empty coffin?”</p>
        <p>“Indeed, time has passed and things have changed. At that time, he called me ‘Leader Niè’ instead of ‘HuáiSāng-xiōng’*.” said Niè HuáiSāng inwardly.</p>
        <small>*xiōng means literally brother. The suffix is informal and more friendly. So, Niè HuáiSāng complains that Wèi WúXiàn addresses him in formal way.</small>
        <p>Should they save Wèi WúXiàn, or should they not? The underling appeared to be nervous. It was impossible for him to guess what their leader was thinking, because whether he was happy or angry, Niè HuáiSāng would not let it show.</p>
        <p>After a while, Niè HuáiSāng said, “Give me the fireworks.”</p>
        <p>Concealing his disappointment, the underling respectfully handed four fireworks to their leader. The three of the fireworks belonged to GūsūLán, LánlíngJīn and YúnmèngJiāng sects, while the fourth was their own firework.</p>
        <p>For a while, Niè HuáiSāng fiddled with the fireworks that the underling began to think that their leader had changed his mind.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, Niè HuáiSāng pulled on the four strings of the four fireworks at the same time, and, the very next instance, the four emblems that represented the four sects were flickering in the night sky.</p>
        <p>Letting off the four fireworks was the agreed signal to let other sects know that Wèi WúXiàn was found, as well as giving the exact location he was found.</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng looked up into the sky, and, while gazing at the gorgeous fireworks, he nonchalantly said, “Spread the words of the Wěishàn villagers: ‘Yílíng Lǎozǔ forced us to leave our village, then flooded our homes, and destroyed the graveyard of our ancestors.</p>
        <p>‘He also caused a hundred of us to be separated from our families. The elderly and children were in tears.</p>
        <p>‘HánGuāng-Jūn is bewitched by Yílíng Lǎozǔ, indulging himself in crime, taking advantage of the high status of his sect to bully us. He arrogantly promised to compensate us for all our losses.</p>
        <p>‘And, finally, Yílíng Lǎozǔ experimented a new devilish technique at the remnant of the Ankang embankment that went wrong, and he ended up being washed away by the flood.’ ”</p>
        <p>By the time Niè HuáiSāng finished making up the story, the underling’s whole face lit up with excitement, “My Lord’s words are very thoughtful.”</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng rectified, “It’s not me who said these words. It’s what all the villagers from Wěishàn Village said. ”</p>
        <p>All the rest of underlings understood the cunning plan of their mission.</p>
        <p>Inwardly, Niè HuáiSāng said, “My dear Wèi-xiōng, I don’t have any intention of harming you. It’s just that the power between sects needs to be balanced.</p>
        <p>“However, you are so talented, by yourself you held a turbulent river back for quite a while; it is inconceivable.</p>
        <p>“GūsūLán should not carry on being complacent because they have you, who, alone, can withstand legions of troops.”</p>
        <p>All of a sudden, an ice-blue light flashed close by.</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng asked, “What was that?”</p>
        <p>The underling replied, “My Lord, it was the light produced by a teleportation.”</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng sighed, then said to himself, “HánGuāng-Jūn blew up an extremely stout dam by himself, then, for two days, he hasn’t rested but kept on playing his guqin in order to find Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Despite all this, he still has enough spiritual power to use a teleportation! It’s so lovely to see how deep his love goes.”</p>
        <p>A smiling expression appeared on Niè HuáiSāng’s face. He took off his outer robe, and used it to cover Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Indeed, it was Lán WàngJī who arrived via a teleportation. His hands were shaking, his eyes were red, and his face was deadly pale. In fact, it was his whole appearance that was extremely dreadful.</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng gently said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, don’t worry. Wèi-xiōng is still alive.”</p>
    </div>

        <br />
        <p>In a gentle and sympathetic manner, Lán SīZhuī said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, you haven’t eaten anything for quite a while. Why don’t you go to the kitchen, so that the cook could serve you something to eat. Jīn Líng and I will stay here to watch over Wèi qiánbèi.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “I don’t need anything.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng and Lán SīZhuī exchanged a glance, and the latter shook his head in despair.</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng hesitantly said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, you... you only slept for three hours. Why don’t you rest a little bit more. SīZhuī and I will be waiting outside along with JǐngYí.”</p>
        <p>Noticing that the bed was wide enough, Jīn Líng wanted to add “You could sleep with Wèi WúXiàn”, but, on second thoughts, he bit his tongue.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī simply replied, “I’m fine. Don’t worry. Xiōng-zhǎng* has transferred in me some of his spiritual power.”</p>
        <small>*Lán WàngJī refers to his elder brother, Lán XīChén, also known as Zéwú-Jūn.</small>
        <p>Soon after Jīn Líng and Lán SīZhuī left the room, Lán WàngJī stood up from his chair, and went to sit on the bed. He held Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, closed his eyes and began to meditate.</p>
        <p>Was he tired? Yes, indeed, he was extremely tired. However, he didn’t want to fall asleep and miss the moment Wèi WúXiàn would wake up.</p>
        <p>Somehow, it seemed to Lán WàngJī that he constantly looked for Wèi WúXiàn. During the Shooting Sun campaign, Wèi WúXiàn went missing for three months since no one knew that he was thrown into the pit of the mass burial. After the bloodbath of Nightless Sky City, for thirteen years, he had looked and waited for Wèi WúXiàn to return.</p>
        <p>When Wèi WúXiàn came back, Lán WàngJī swore to protect him. However, despite his protection, Wèi WúXiàn was stabbed by Jīn Líng, and went into a coma for four days.</p>
        <p>Luckily, this time, it only took two days to find Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>And, two days had passed since Lán WàngJī took the unconscious Wèi WúXiàn back to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, after the examination, the doctor didn’t find any internal injury, saying that you had protected your vital organs. In other words, there is nothing serious about your health condition.</p>
        <p>“So, please wake up soon. I miss you.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Outside, Jīn Líng, Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí were sitting on the porch of Jingshi*, and facing the front garden of the house, in which there were various types of plants.</p>
        <small>*Jingshi is the name of the dwelling of Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn.</small>
        <p>It seemed that Wèi WúXiàn had taken a liking to planting many different kinds of vegetation; he would, for instance, on one day dig a small pool for lotus plants, and on another day he would make a small squared field to grow watermelons, and so on.</p>
        <p>Moreover, here and there, there were different varieties of flowering plants, which offered a beautiful spring view.</p>
        <p>The front garden of Jingshi did no longer look like the previous plain garden.</p>
        <p>However, this splendid view was not enough to soothe Jīn Líng from being restless, plucking the flower stem of an orchid, he began to fidget with it, while Lán JǐngYí glared angrily at him for plucking the orchid, when, suddenly, they heard Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you’re awake.”</p>
        <p>The three of them rushed to get into the room, Lán JǐngYí tripped over the threshold and fell on the floor, Jīn Líng jumped over him and dashed towards the bed.</p>
        <p>Although his eyes were wide open, Wèi WúXiàn’s vision was blurred. Covering his forehead with one hand, and, with an alarming voice, he cried, “A child! There is a child!”</p>
        <p>Then, he raised his head, and, finally, he began to see clearly. He said, “It’s you, Lán Zhàn? Lán Zhàn, save the child, save the little baby.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī held his hand and said, “The baby is safe and sound. I found her by tracking your signal-transfer talisman. Right now, she is at the convent, and the nuns are taking care of her.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Oh, really?”</p>
        <p>Feeling a sudden sharp pain in his head as he tried to recall what happened, Wèi WúXiàn pressed his fingers on his temples, he had a vague recollection of the baby, however, he could not remember exactly who that baby was.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí had also reached the sickbed, Lán JǐngYí said, “Wèi qiánbèi, you scared us to death.”</p>
        <p>In a reproachful tone, Jīn Líng said, “Why are you always acting so recklessly? Are you still a kid or what?”</p>
        <p>Perplexed, Wèi WúXiàn looked at the three young boys, and noted that one was wearing a golden gown with a beautifully embroidered white peony on the chest, while the other two were wearing GūsūLán’s uniforms; a white gown with broad sleeves, an ornamental pendant dangling from the waist-belt, and a forehead ribbon with the curl cloud motifs.</p>
        <p>The three of them were looking at him with concern.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Who are you?”,  casting a quick look across the room, he added,  “And, where am I?” </p>
        <p>With a great astonishment, they all stared at Wèi WúXiàn in disbelief.</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng asked, “You don’t recognise me?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn looked carefully at the handsome young boy with a red dot on the forehead, and noticed that he bore a faint resemblance to Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>He replied, “Sorry, I have a poor memory. I don’t recall seeing you before.”</p>
        <p>Not losing a moment, Lán JǐngYí asked, “Wèi qiánbèi, what about me? Don’t you remember me?”</p>
        <p>In a dispirited tone, Lán SīZhuī said, “Wèi qiánbèi, it’s me, SīZhuī.”</p>
        <p>With great attention, Wèi WúXiàn looked in turn at the two elegant boys of the young generation of the GūsūLán clan, then he shook his head in negation.</p>
        <p>Irritated, Jīn Líng thundered, “Wèi WúXiàn, if you are joking again, I’ll---”, he suddenly realised that Lán WàngJī was in the room, and quickly shut his mouth in panic.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn followed Jīn Líng’s gaze, as the latter cast a quick look at Lán WàngJī, who, in this room, was the only person Wèi WúXiàn knew.</p>
        <p>Then, all of a sudden, he asked, “Lán Zhàn, why are you looking so pale?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī, to whom the loss of Wèi WúXiàn’s memories came as a great blow, slowly began to loose his fist that he had clenched in shock. “At least, he still remember me.”, he said inwardly.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī gently said, “Wèi Yīng, this room’s name is Jingshi, it’s one of the dwellings of the GūsūLán residence. Right now, you are at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.”</p>
        <p>After a short pause, Lán WàngJī asked, “Wèi Yīng, what do you remember?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then tried hard to recall what he recently did or planned to do. There were buzzing noises inside his head, then, with a confusing mind, he suddenly cried, “Jīn Líng! I’m going to see Jīn Líng! The baby! I have to save the baby!”</p>
        <p>Then, he grabbed Lán WàngJīi’s sleeve, and asked, “Why do I remember that there is a baby who needs help? Is it Jīn Líng? Quick, take me to Jīnlíntái*!”</p>
        <small>*Jīnlíntái is the residence of the LánlíngJīn sect.</small>
        <p>Lán WàngJī held Wèi WúXiàn’s both hands, then said, “Wèi Yīng, calm down. It’s not Jīn Líng. It’s a baby girl whom you have already saved.”</p>
        <p>He resumed after a short pause, “Wèi Yīng, you had been washed away by the flood, then you went into a coma for four days. As a result, you have developed amnesia.”</p>
        <p>Pausing again to let Wèi WúXiàn understand the situation, Lán WàngJī once more reassured him, “Don’t worried for the baby girl. She is now at the GūsūLán’s convent.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn murmured to himself, “It’s not Jīn Líng.”</p>
        <p>Then, he looked up at Lán WàngJī, and said, “So, the one I rescued is not Jīn Líng but a baby girl.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Yes, that’s right.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then asked, “Is the baby safe now?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “She is safe and sound. Later on, I’ll send someone to bring the baby here so you can see her for yourself.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “And, what about Jīn Líng?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī cast a look at Jīn Líng, then replied, “Jīn Líng is also safe and sound.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī’s voice was deep and pleasing to the ear, it had a relaxing effect on Wèi WúXiàn’s anxious mind.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn finally calmed himself down, and appeared to be relieved. He said inwardly, “Since Lán Zhàn said that Jīn Líng is fine, then it must be true.” The noises inside his head began gradually to vanish.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī asked, “Wèi Yīng, what are your most recent memories? For example, what did happen yesterday or today? Or, what did you plan on doing tomorrow?”</p>
        <p>Carefully, Wèi WúXiàn tried to recollect his memories, then said, “The full month banquet! Tomorrow, I’m going to attend Jīn Líng’s one-month-old banquet.”</p>
        <p>Somehow, Wèi WúXiàn could not explain why it didn’t feel strange the fact that Lán WàngJī, who was sitting beside him, still holding his both hands.</p>
        <p>With his head tilted to one side, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Lán Zhàn, are you coming as well?”</p>
        <p>Then, all of a sudden, he became very agitated again, he cried, “The silver orb! Where is the silver orb? You said that I was washed away by the flood, then, the sliver orb that I had on my sleeve is lost!”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng who, until now, was sulking could no longer hold his tongue, he asked, “What kind of silver orb?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn looked at Jīn Líng and sensed some sort of familiarity with him, he said, “I think there is no harm in telling you. It is the full month gift that I carved for Jīn Líng. It has a powerful charm to ward off evil spirits.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng became overwhelmed with emotion, which brought tears in his eyes. He took off his ring and handed it over to Wèi WúXiàn, while asking, “Is this ring has the same kind of the charm you just mentioned?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn took the ring and slightly stroked the golden stars engraved on it, then said, “Indeed, it has a similar charm, which is slightly better than the one I made.”</p>
        <p>“Oh!” he added, “Besides warding off evil spirits, the ring has other spells added into it.” </p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn carried on examining the ring, then said, “The person who made this charm is a genius, who is fairly better than me.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng took a deep breath, exchanged a glance with Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí, then, looking straight at Wèi WúXiàn, he calmly said, “I am Jīn Líng.”</p>
        <p>As Wèi WúXiàn got puzzled by what he just heard, Lán WàngJī briefly explained him the situation.</p>
        <p>“So, what you mean is...” Wèi WúXiàn remarked while eating the bowl of congee that Lán WàngJī served him, “... as I woke up from the coma, I have lost twenty years of memories.”</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, is it true?” he asked after a short pause.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “Yes, it’s true.”</p>
        <p>After finishing the bowl of congee, Wèi WúXiàn felt that his mind was completely cleared up, he said, “This is really interesting.”</p>
        <p>With a smile on his face, Wèi WúXiàn looked at Jīn Líng, then he said, “In other words, I didn’t see Jīn Líng when he was a baby, however, right now, I have in front of me the grown-up Jīn Líng.”</p>
        <p>Unsure, Jīn Líng asked, “Do you really accept as true that I am Jīn Líng?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn replied, “Of course, I do. Why should I not accept it since HánGuāng-Jūn already said that it’s true?”</p>
        <p>“Hmm! The congee was really delicious.” Wèi WúXiàn remarked, “Lán Zhàn, GūsūLán has improved the taste of its cooking.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī served him another bowl of congee.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn carried on, “Jīn Líng, to tell the truth, you look a little bit like your father, and a little bit like Jiāng Chéng. You even carry Suìhuá*. ”</p>
        <small>*Suìhuá is the sword of Jīn Líng’s father.</small>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn began to toss the ring up into the air, while saying, “Besides a genius like myself, I wonder who else is capable of making such a powerful charm.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng was speechless, for an instance, he felt that Wèi WúXiàn didn’t lose his memories.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn gave back the ring to Jīn Líng, and asked, “What is the name of your ring?”</p>
        <p>“Golden Lightning.” replied Jīn Líng.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “This name is really dull. Can’t you come up with another better name?”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng replied, “For example, The Supreme Mythical Peerless Precious Ring.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Yes, why not?”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng rolled his eyes in disbelief.</p>
    </div>

        <br />
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled, then said, “So, you came here for me, waiting until I woke up. As for me, I had prepared a present for you. In other words, you and I have a good relationship.”</p>
        <p>“What about your mother?” Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Where is she? Is she all right?”</p>
        <p>Instantly, a dead silence fell into the room.</p>
        <p>However, before Lán WàngJī could step in, Jīn Líng had already collected himself, and, like a shooting star, he replied, “She has gone to the eastern regions along with father.</p>
        <p>“Since you wanted absolutely to protect the last Wēn clan, mother wanted to protect you. Therefore, father decided to send them to the eastern regions, where he found a new place for them to settle.</p>
        <p>“From time to time, mother and father go there to pay them a visit on your behalf.”</p>
        <p>“A few years ago,  father was tired of whole clan’s affairs,” carried on Jīn Líng, “he wanted to spend more time with mother, so he designated me to become the leader our clan, then, along with mother, they have set off on journey, sightseeing the eastern regions.”</p>
        <p>Out of the blue, Jīn Líng said all those lies, causing Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí to be so dumbfounded that they didn’t even dare to move a muscle.</p>
        <p>“Is Jīn ZiXuān* that amazing?” Wèi WúXiàn seemed to talk to himself rather asking. Then, after a short pause of thinking, he added, “That’s right! Occasionally, he shows some courage.”</p>
        <small>*Jīn ZiXuān is Jīn Líng’s father.</small>
        <p>He then asked, “Lán Zhàn, is what Jīn Líng said true?”</p>
        <p>Anxious, Jīn Líng clenched his fists tight, waiting to see if Lán WàngJī would cooperate or not. Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí were also nervous.</p>
        <p>In a deep voice, Lán WàngJī replied, “Yes.”</p>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn quickly asked, “Then, what about me? Since the last Wēn clan left for eastern regions, what has become of me?”</p>
        <p>Cocksure, Jīn Líng replied, “You have joined our LánlíngJīn sect, and become my underling.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī glanced at Jīn Líng, and the latter, feeling embarrassed, lowered his head.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn observed Lán WàngJī’s expression, and, with a smile on his face, he said, “That was a lie. However, according to what you said before, I’ve probably rejoined the YúnmèngJiāng sect.”</p>
        <p>While he carried on eating, Wèi WúXiàn said, “This congee is really tasty. Some fish has been added into it. What kind of fish is it?”</p>
        <p>“It’s dace fillets.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “It’s so tender and delicious. Has this dish always been part of GūsūLán cooking?”</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly something crossed his mind, he said: “Eh! Lán Zhàn, why you haven’t said yet ‘Don’t speak while eating’?”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng spoke before Lán WàngJī could reply, “Hey! If you can walk, let’s go to the Elegant Room after you finish eating. My uncle is there. He has been waiting for you to wake up.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Your uncle? Oh, you mean Jiāng Chéng.”, then he realised, “Wait a minute! Why did you use ‘hey’ to call me, while you called Jiāng Chéng ‘uncle’? Am I not also your uncle?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī cast a look at Jīn Líng.</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng reluctantly said, “All right! I’ll call you ‘uncle Wèi’, and keep calling him ‘uncle’.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “It sounds like you are more closer to Jiāng Chéng than me. A-Líng*, I had made a powerful charm just for you. Why don’t you also form a strong attachment to me?”</p>
        <small>*A in A-Líng is prefix used before the “first name”, it indicates a close relationship. (It’s pronounced like the letter ‘a’ in the word ‘cat’.)</small>
        <p>“Uncle gave me a spiritual dog.” replied Jīn Líng.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “A spiritual dog.”</p>
        <p>“That’s right!” said Jīn Líng, “I’ve already had a male spiritual dog. Uncle said that I could mate it with another dog, so he gave me a female spiritual dog.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng carried on, “Maybe, next year, I will have a litter of puppies.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn hopelessly said, “All right! There’s no need to compare the gift that Jiāng Chéng gave you with mine.”</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, wait before going to the Elegant Room. I’m going to send someone to bring the baby girl here.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn replied, “Okay.”</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī signed to Lán JǐngYí and Jīn Líng to follow him outside.</p>
        <p>As they three left the room, Wèi WúXiàn began to chat with Lán SīZhuī, while eating his bowl of congee.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, as they reached the gate of Jingshi courtyard, Lán WàngJī said to Lán JǐngYí not to tell anyone about Wèi WúXiàn’s amnesia, then sent him to the convent.</p>
        <p>He then waited until Lán JǐngYí was out of earshot, and then asked Jīn Líng, “How did you come up with that made-up story?”</p>
        <p>Lowering his head, Jīn Líng replied, “For the past few years, I have been thinking that if, that day, uncle Yáo* had succeeded in escaping to eastern regions that would be good.” </p>
        <small>*Jīn Líng refers to his father’s brother, Jīn GuāngYáo, who failed to get away from his countless crimes.</small>
        <p>Jīn Líng cast a quick look at Lán WàngJī, and, as he noticed that the latter was not displeased with what he just said, he carried on, “Last year, on my birthday banquet, Wèi WúXiàn and you told me that my parents were the most kind-hearted people, that my father was wonderful and reliable person.</p>
        <p>“That night of my birthday, I dreamt of my father. In my dream, father saved SīZhuī, he also saved Wèi WúXiàn and mother. Many other people were also saved by him. In that dream, my father became a great hero.</p>
        <p>“Ever since, I have that dream going on and on in my head. So, earlier, somehow, all those words spontaneously came out of my mouth.”</p>
        <p>Then, he hesitantly asked, “Will..., uh, will he be able to recover his memories?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Is it not a good thing that he doesn’t remember all those painful memories?” remarked Jīn Líng.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “One must face the facts, even though those facts are hard to surmount.” then, he added, “Go ahead to the Elegant Room, and inform Leader Jiāng about the current state of Wèi Yīng.”</p>
        <p>“All right.” said Jīn Líng, “I’ll also tell him to keep it secret.” </p>
        <br />
        <p>… … …</p>
        <br />
        <p>An irregular yet charming mountain landscape, which, throughout the year, was surrounded by the white clouds, was the spectacular view offered by the GūsūLán residence. Being part of it was like living in a fairyland.</p>
        <p>The early-morning mist had not cleared yet, and, with the exception of the chimes, the surroundings was still and quiet, making one feel completely at ease.</p>
        <p>Even though the place was not a Buddhist temple, still it had the serenity of one.</p>
        <p>On their way to the Elegant Room, Wèi WúXiàn remarked, “Lán Zhàn, Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù has not changed at all.”</p>
        <p>“Uh-huh.” agreed Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>With his memories lost, the amnesia Wèi WúXiàn was happy to see Jīn Líng at last.</p>
        <p>Also, it was a weight off his shoulders learning that the last Wēn clan was safe and sound. He felt relieved and more relaxed, as though he was rescued from a shipwreck.</p>
        <p>A short time ago, he saw the little baby girl. Although he still didn’t remember anything, but just looking at the baby, who was sleeping soundly, with tints of pink on her cheeks, and whom he saved as he learned, made him extremely happy.</p>
        <p>He also saw the doctor, who examined him for a while in an attempt to find the cause of his amnesia but failed.</p>
        <p>By nature, Wèi WúXiàn had always been easy-going. Right now, he had a carefree attitude, feeling restful, and easily accepting that twenty years had passed, in which he had no recollections of it. He just cheerfully went with the flow.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, have you found the parents of that little baby?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“I haven’t.” replied Lán WàngJī, “I asked everyone from Wěishàn Village, they all answered that none of their children are missing.”</p>
        <p>“Oh! In other words, she was abandoned.” said Wèi WúXiàn, “This is so pitiful. When I was a child, and before uncle Jiāng found me, I also was all alone, not because I was abandoned, it was because my parents had passed away.”</p>
        <p>He then asked, “Lán Zhàn, will GūsūLán carry on looking after her?”</p>
        <p>“Of course.” Lán WàngJī replied.</p>
        <p>“To have been given the opportunity to grow up at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù was a blessing.” thought Wèi WúXiàn. Deep down, he appreciated GūsūLán’s kindness towards the little baby.</p>
        <p>When he started to live at Lotus Piers, Wèi WúXiàn grew up among many young brothers and a big sister. So, being an orphan did not affected his childhood at all.</p>
        <p>He was sure that the baby would grow up happily among GūsūLán disciples. There was no need to worry about it.</p>
        <p>He then asked, “Has GūsūLán given her a name?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “Not yet.”</p>
        <p>“In that case, I’ll give her a nickname.” said Wèi WúXiàn, “After all, I was the one who saved her. GūsūLán can call her by her nickname.”</p>
        <p>“All right.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Since she has a round and reddish face, I’ll call her Little Apple*.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <small>*Little Apple is the name Wèi WúXiàn gives to his donkey in the original story.</small>
        <p>At the instant the words ‘Little Apple’ reached his ears, Lán WàngJī stopped abruptly, as if he was struck by lightning.</p>
        <p>Observing Lán WàngJī’s reaction, Wèi WúXiàn said, “You don’t like it? It’s just a nickname. If we call her ‘little angel’ or ‘little baby’, I’m afraid that every little child would think that they have been called. While ‘Little Apple’ is more specific.”</p>
        <p>Collecting himself, Lán WàngJī replied, “It’s perfect.”</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, after twenty years, your personality becomes more gentle. You even said ‘perfect’ to my suggestion. As far as I can remember you’ve never praised me before.” remarked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>He then carried on, “I was washed away by the flood. Was it you who found me?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “It was Niè HuáiSāng who found you. He then notified me.”</p>
        <p>Confused, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Why did he notify you instead of Jiāng Chéng?”</p>
        <p>Ignoring Wèi WúXiàn’s question, Lán WàngJī asked, “Wèi Yīng, do you feel any discomfort anywhere in your body?”</p>
        <p>The sudden change of the topic puzzled Wèi WúXiàn. However, he did not insist on the matter, he simply replied, “Not at all. I had a headache when I woke up. However, right now, I’m feeling completely fine.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “According to what the doctor said, your amnesia is temporary, that you will soon recover your memories.”</p>
        <p>With a complete trust in Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn said, “All right, then. I won’t ask any more questions. I’ll wait until I regain all my lost memories. And when that time comes, everything that I don’t understand now will become clear to me.”</p>
        <p>“We arrived at Elegant Room.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Raising his head, Wèi WúXiàn saw the ‘Elegant Room’ characters written on the top of the entrance. However, he seemed to hesitate to enter the room. </p>
        <p>After they had pretended to severe their relationship, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t know if he was currently on good or bad terms with Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>Earlier, he found it awkward to inquire about it in front of Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí. Unfortunately, Jīn Líng left before he could find the opportunity to told to him alone. </p>
        <p>Noticing Wèi WúXiàn’s hesitation, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, your relationship with Jiāng WǎnYín* has already improved considerably.”</p>
        <small>*Jiāng WǎnYín is Jiāng Chéng’s given name.</small>
        <p>“The issue of the last Wēn clan has already been solved.” said Wèi WúXiàn inwardly, “So, that probably means that Jiāng Chéng and I have been reconciled with each other.”</p>
        <p>He carried on thinking, “To think that Lán Zhàn is so good at observing people really surprised me. He actually knew that I was thinking.”</p>

        <br />
        <p>As they stepped into the Elegant Room, they found Lán XīChén, Jiāng Chéng and Jīn Líng.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī glanced at Jīn Líng, and the latter nodded to him, signalling that he had already told the other two about Wèi WúXiàn’s amnesia.</p>
        <p>Being by nature very kind and gentle, Lán XīChén was wearing a warm smile on his face. His smile, however, was less bright compared to the smile of Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng was just like in Wèi WúXiàn’s old memories, with thin eyebrows and almond shape-like eyes, a fierce and  penetrating look on his face. When he saw Wèi WúXiàn coming in, his facial expression changed, a change that was hard to describe.</p>
        <p>In a pleasant and friendly tone, Lán XīChén said, “WàngJī and WúXiàn, here you are.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn bowed, and inwardly said, “Just now, Zéwú-Jūn called me ‘WúXiàn’ instead of ‘Wèi-gōngzǐ’*. Do we already have such a close familiarity?”</p>
        <small>*gōngzǐ is a honorific title. The suffix is formal compared to ‘xiōng’ in ‘Wèi-xiōng’, which is informal.</small>
        <p>“Have you seen a doctor?” asked Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>Before Wèi WúXiàn could replied, Lán WàngJī spoke, “He is in good health condition. However, the cause of his amnesia is known. Anyway, the doctor said that he will recover his memories shortly.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng knew that, for Wèi WúXiàn’s sake, Lán WàngJī would certainly request the best doctor. So, there was no need for him to worry about it.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “It doesn’t really matter that I have lost my memories, because I’m still alive and well. So, for the time being, you can tell me, little by little, what happened during these twenty years.”</p>
        <p>“My old boy, are you taking twenty years for few days?” remarked Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>He was aware that, once more, Wèi WúXiàn has lost his golden core, and was very upset about it.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Right now, I’m lacking twenty years of memories. Therefore, compared to all of you, I am twenty years younger than you. So, yes, indeed, I can take twenty years for few days.”</p>
        <p>While smiling, Lán XīChén said, “WúXiàn has always been philosophical. That’s great!” Then, he turned towards Lán WàngJī, and said, “WàngJī, you no longer need to worry about it.”</p>
        <p>With a bright smile on his face, Wèi WúXiàn inquired, “What is he worried about? Oh! I’ve got it!” </p>
        <p>Then, he asked, “Lán Zhàn, are you worried about me?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī cast a glance at his elder brother for help. However, Lán XīChén remained silent while he kept smiling.</p>
        <p>Pushed into the corner, Lán WàngJī replied, “Yes.”.</p>
        <p>“Yes, what?” Wèi WúXiàn playfully teased him.</p>
        <p>“I’m worried about you.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Dumbfounded, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t really expect to hear Lán WàngJī uttered those words.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng stared open-mouthed at the scene that was playing in front of him. He then exchanged glances with Jīn Líng, and then rolled his eyes.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Jīn Líng stealthily told his uncle that he wanted to take Wèi WúXiàn with him back to Jīnlíntái, making Wèi WúXiàn a member of his LánlíngJīn clan.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng told him that there was no way Lán WàngJī would let go of Wèi WúXiàn. He also added that, whether he had lost his memories or not, Wèi WúXiàn would choose to stay with Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Lán XīChén brought a flute and a sword, and said to Wèi WúXiàn, “Suíbiàn is intact, however, since Chénqíng was underwater for twenty four hours, I have carried out a check to make sure that it’s fine.”</p>
        <p>He then added, “WúXiàn, since you woke up, I give them back to you.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was somewhat puzzled, wondering why Lán XīChén would take care of his flute and sword. Nevertheless, he respectfully took Suíbiàn and Chénqíng, and said, “Thank you very much, Zéwú-Jūn.”</p>
        <p>“It was WàngJī who found them.” said Lán XīChén.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn only said, “Oh!”</p>
        <p>He unconsciously did not express his gratitude towards Lán WàngJī, since they both have already agreed that, between them, there was no need for it. He then hanged his sword and flute on his waist-belt.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, did you specially go there to look for them?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“I wasn’t only looking for them. I was also searching for you.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Wow! Apparently, you have been really concerned about me.” then, he added, “Lán Zhàn, you become more honest now.”</p>
        <p>Since they were teenagers, Jiāng Chéng knew how Wèi WúXiàn enjoyed teasing Lán WàngJī. Right now, observing Wèi WúXiàn’s mood brought Jiāng Chéng back to those old days.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, as Jiāng Chéng watched Wèi WúXiàn who started again to tease Lán WàngJī, the back then images of the two and the present scene in front of him overlapped each other.</p>
        <p>All of a sudden, he said, “Wèi WúXiàn, I want to talk to you in private.” having no desire of wasting time.</p>
        <p>In an instant, the smile on Wèi WúXiàn’s face froze, Jīn Líng became nervous, and Lán XīChén put his hand on Lán WàngJī’s shoulder by means of soothing him.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng and Wèi WúXiàn left the Elegant Room, and walked until they arrived at a pavilion located next to the mountain path.</p>
        <p>From the pavilion, there was a beautiful view of an array of trees at the base of the mountains. Nearby, wildflowers released their delicate fragrance that spread around the pavilion.</p>
        <p>However, the two people inside the pavilion, having their minds full of concerns, failed to appreciate the beauty of their surroundings.</p>
        <p>Earlier, in Jingshi, because he was not familiar with Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí,  Wèi WúXiàn, despite having many questions to ask, decided to wait until he got the opportunity for it.</p>
        <p>And, right now, he had the opportunity, and opted for a topic which was less sensitive.</p>
        <p>“Jiāng Chéng, why was I washed away by the flood?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng replied, “After the dragon that was hidden deep in a pond flew away, a torrential rain began to pour down. This heavy rain caused flash floods that inundated many downstream locations.</p>
        <p>“You went to Ankang River, and, using your demonic power, you built a barrier that held the flow of water back. However, when the barrier collapsed, you were carried by the turbulent river.”</p>
        <p>“Wow! I’m quite heroic.” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>And Jiāng Chéng rolled his eyes.</p>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn was deep in thought, “I actually went to Ankang River to build a barrier. And, Ankang is located close to the upper reaches of Han River. And, Han River flows across the whole territory of Yúnmèng.</p>
        <p>“In other words, I was in charge of handling Yúnmèng issues. That means that Jiāng Chéng really trusted me to tackle those issues.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Right now, what is the situation of the flooded areas?”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng replied, “Fortunately, the heavy rain only lasted twenty four hours. After that, the sky cleared up.</p>
        <p>“The upper reaches of Han River’s issues were successfully handled by Lán WàngJī together with you. As for the lower reaches, safety precautions have been taken in advance.</p>
        <p>“In the end, it was more frightened than hurt.”</p>
        <p>Surprised, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Did I go there along with Lán Zhàn?”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng looked disgustingly at him, while grinding his teeth. Then, he replied, “Yes.”</p>
        <p>“So, that means that we both get along perfectly fine, then.” remarked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>With a sneer, Jiāng Chéng said, “You both get along better than you think.” Then, he inwardly said, “You two got married, and your surname becomes ‘Lán Wèi’.”</p>
        <p>With a smile on his face, Wèi WúXiàn said, “You didn’t believe me when I said that he definitely likes me.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng was lost for words. Back then, he strongly believed that Lán WàngJī hated Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then said, “Usually, water ghouls emerge after a flood. As the leader, should you not be there, preventing those water ghouls from harming people?”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng replied, “Because someone went into a coma that, in order to check on him, I have to fly on my sword to get here, after patrolling the whole area. And, by chance, today, that person finally happened to wake up.”</p>
        <p>Listening to Jiāng Chéng’s words warmed Wèi WúXiàn’s heart, he said, “Sect Leader Jiāng is a high-minded gentleman. Thank you for the hard work.”</p>
        <p>In his friendly disposition, Wèi WúXiàn put his arm around Jiāng Chéng’s shoulders, and gave him a little punch to the stomach. Just like when they were teenagers.</p>
        <p>Since he didn’t expect to see Wèi WúXiàn behaving in this way towards him, Jiāng Chéng was stunned. He then quickly regained his composure, and punched back.</p>
        <p>Having passed through so many years of hardship, which had devastated their happy memories of when they used to put their arms around each other shoulders, now, finally, all those bad days were swept away by the howling gale.</p>
        <p>With the mountain breeze blowing on his face, Jiāng Chéng remained silent.</p>
        <p>Still having his arm around Jiāng Chéng’s shoulders, Wèi WúXiàn noticed the change in Jiāng Chéng’s mood. However, he did not remove his arm around his shoulders. Jiāng Chéng, on the other hand, did not push him away either.</p>
        <p>After a while, Jiāng Chéng asked, “Don’t you have something you want to tell me?”</p>
        <p>“I am the one here who has lost his memories. Shouldn’t it be you who has a lot tell me?” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Noticing that Jiāng Chéng’s expression had suddenly changed, Wèi WúXiàn had second thoughts. He said inwardly, “For things I still want to know, I think I’d better ask Lán Zhàn, later on, rather than asking Jiāng Chéng.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng said, “Don’t you think that things, which were concealed, would not be revealed during all these twenty years?”</p>
        <p>Puzzled, Wèi WúXiàn removed his arm around Jiāng Chéng’s shoulders, and, by joking, he said, “I think you have got taller than me. It becomes a little bit hard for me to put my arm around your shoulders.”</p>
        <p>Inwardly, Jiāng Chéng said, “That’s because your former physical appearance has been substituted with a shorter one.”</p>
        <p>Then, aloud, he said, “Don’t change the subject.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn remained silent for a while, then said, “I don’t know what you are referring to.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, really?” retorted Jiāng Chéng. Then he said, “Give me your sword.”</p>
        <p>“Suíbiàn?!”, exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, “Why do you want it for?”</p>
        <p>“Lend it to me.” insisted Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn took off Suíbiàn from his waist-belt, and handed it to Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>While taking the sword, Jiāng Chéng was thinking of the fact that Wèi WúXiàn had formed a new golden core, however, because of Yúnmèng flash floods, his golden core was shattered into pieces. He was very upset, and didn’t know who to blame for it.</p>
        <p>Then, he tried to pull out the sword, but couldn’t unsheathe Suíbiàn.</p>
        <p>Using his spiritual power, Jiāng Chéng tried again to draw Suíbiàn. However, he was still unable to pull it out.</p>
        <p>All of a sudden, Jiāng Chéng annoyingly burst into laugher. Then, without turning his head, he called out loudly, “HánGuāng-Jūn, where are you?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn turned his head and looked, but he didn’t see anyone.</p>
        <p>“Lán WàngJī is definitely nearby. Call him to come over here.” said Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn could not make heads or tails of what Jiāng Chéng was up to. Nevertheless, turning towards the mountain path, he called out, “Lán Zhàn, are you around? Can you come over here?”</p>
        <p>Soon after, Lán WàngJī came out from the grove at the foot of the mountain, and walked up slowly.</p>
        <p>Indeed, he was close by, choosing a spot in which he would not be within earshot. However, since he was somehow connected to Wèi WúXiàn, he was able to hear Wèi WúXiàn calling him.</p>
        <p>Intuitively, Jiāng Chéng sensed that something was off. With a sneer, he pointed Suíbiàn towards Lán WàngJī, and said, “Pull it out.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī had already understood the meaning behind Jiāng Chéng’s actions. He took Suíbiàn, and slowly began to pull it out. Instantly, as Lán WàngJī progressively drew Suíbiàn* from its sheath, the reflection of light on the surface of the sword blade shone brightly.</p>
        <small>*Suíbiàn sealed itself after Wèi WúXiàn’s death. However, apart from Wèi WúXiàn, Jiāng Chéng was the only one to draw Suíbiàn, because, the years prior to his death, when Jiāng Chéng’s golden core had been melted, Wèi WúXiàn secretly gave him his own golden core.</small>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng exclaimed, “What’s the meaning of this?”</p>
        <p>Still in the dark, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “What on earth are you both playing at?”</p>
        <p>Then, Jiāng Chéng stormed, “Wèi WúXiàn, don’t you want to know where you have been, and what you have been doing during all these years?”</p>
        <p>Both Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn looked nervously at Jiāng Chéng.</p>

        <br />
        <p>“After destroying the ‘Tiger Talisman’, you died.</p>
        <p>“Seven years ago, Mò XuánYǔ, the illegitimate son of Jīn GuāngShàn*, summoned you by offering his own body.</p>
        <small>*Jīn GuāngShàn is the former leader of LánlíngJīn sect, and Jīn Líng’s grandfather.</small>
        <p>“However, people still consider you as an evil heretic, thinking that Lán WàngJī protects you because he is possessed by your evil spirit.</p>
        <p>“Ever since you came back, you have been with Lán WàngJī day and night, doing everything together with him.” uttered Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn turned towards Lán WàngJī and asked, “All this Jiāng Chéng just said, is it true?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “Yes.”</p>
        <p>Then, inwardly, he said, “Indeed, everything that was said is true, but the most important thing is left out. His account doesn’t contain all the facts.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was stunned by those revelations, inwardly he went over, “I have been with Lán Zhàn continuously, like two people living together. Moreover, people are still seeing me like a devil, and, in order to protect me, Lán Zhàn compromises himself.”</p>
        <p>Then, aloud, he quickly said, “Jiāng Chéng, let’s go back for now. We’ll talk about it once get home.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng stared blankly at Wèi WúXiàn, and when he spoke, he sounded a bit hoarse, “You want to go back to Lotus Piers with me?!”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn replied, “Yes, of course. We---”</p>
        <p>At that instant, Wèi WúXiàn noticed Lán WàngJī’s expression, and couldn’t finish his sentence. Such deep sorrow that he read on his face was unbearable.</p>
        <p>Forgetting that Lán WàngJī once told him that he didn’t like physical contact, Wèi WúXiàn held Lán WàngJī’s hand, and, in haste, he said, “Lán Zhàn, why are you so sad? You look so dreadful. If you want me to stay, then I’ll stay with you. As for what happened during these past years, you can tell me about it later on.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng then examined Lán WàngJī’s face, however, all he could see was the usual poker-faced expression that Lán WàngJī always wore on his face.</p>
        <p>Inwardly he said, “How on earth Wèi WúXiàn managed to see any sadness on Lán WàngJī’s face? Furthermore, I don’t see him looking dreadful at all.”</p>
        <p>Turning towards Jiāng Chéng, Lán WàngJī said, “Leader Jiāng, may I have a word with you?”</p>
        <p>Leaving the two of them in the pavilion, Wèi WúXiàn walked down the mountain path, and stood at the same spot where Lán WàngJī was standing earlier.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng’s account was still running through his mind, “Lán Zhàn and I live together. People still hate me. So, Lán Zhàn protects me.</p>
        <p>“Perhaps the reason why we live together is that some people want to kill me, so Lán Zhàn is protecting me day and night like a bodyguard. Lán Zhàn, why are you willing to go so far?”</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in the pavilion, Jiāng Chéng sneered, “HánGuāng-Jūn, you are so lucky. Although, Wèi WúXiàn has lost his memories, he still likes you so much.”</p>
        <p>Indifferent to Jiāng Chéng’s sarcasm, Lán WàngJī said, “Yes, indeed, I am lucky.”</p>
        <p>Taken by surprise, Jiāng Chéng’s mouth was agape at Lán WàngJī’s remark.</p>
        <p>Then, after a while, he asked, “Are you not going to tell him that you both are already married?”</p>
        <p>“I have not as yet planned on telling him.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng resolved not to interfere on their marital matter. He then asked, “Why couldn’t I draw Suíbiàn?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “The properties of Wèi Yīng’s golden core have been modified.”</p>
        <p>In a husky voice, Jiāng Chéng said, “Didn’t you say before that his golden core was shattered into pieces?”</p>
        <p>“I had examined his golden core vessel, yesterday, and noted that there’s still a chance.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Delighted, Jiāng Chéng asked, “There’s still a chance to reconstruct his golden core?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “The chance of rebuilding a golden core is within seven days. Four days has already passed since his golden core has been damaged. There’s still three days to reconstruct it.”</p>
        <p>In one go, Jiāng Chéng eagerly asked multiple questions, “Are you sure of that? How can you be so certain about your diagnosis? And, more importantly, how did Wèi WúXiàn manage to form a golden core in the first place?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī remained silent for a while, then, he baldly replied, “Through the dual cultivation.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng fell into stunned silence.</p>
        <p>Then, he inwardly said, “I see. It is no wonder that his golden core’s properties have been changed.”</p>
        <p>He then thought of what Lán WàngJī said before, “Lán WàngJī said that he had examined Wèi WúXiàn’s golden core vessel to see if it was possible to reconstruct his golden core.</p>
        <p>“In other words, Wèi WúXiàn has been practising the dual cultivation with Lán WàngJī.” Jiāng Chéng kept on repeating this last sentence in his mind.</p>
        <p>After a while, he sincerely said, “Thank you for all you have done for him.”</p>
        <p>Ever since Wèi WúXiàn had returned, this was the first time that Jiāng Chéng spoke to Lán WàngJī without being sarcastic.</p>
        <br />
        <p>… … … </p>
        <br />
        <p>As Lán WàngJī joined Wèi WúXiàn, the latter asked, “Where is Jiāng Chéng?”</p>
        <p>“He has left.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>After learning about the dual cultivation, and being aware of what it implied, Jiāng Chéng felt awkward. He was so embarrassed that he knew that he wouldn’t be able to make eye contact with Wèi WúXiàn. Since he had other matters to attend to, he took it as an excuse to leave straight away.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “He left without saying goodbye. And, what about Jīn Líng?”</p>
        <p>“They left together.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Oh! I almost forgot. Jīn Líng is also a sect leader.” said Wèi WúXiàn, somehow, he could not help but feel disappointed for not seeing Jīn Líng one more time. He added, “I wanted to talk to him once more.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Jīn Líng will probably come again tomorrow.” then he asked, “Wèi Yīng, do you want to see the rabbits?”</p>
        <p>Surprised, Wèi WúXiàn said, “There are rabbits at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù!”</p>
        <p>“Back then, you gave me two rabbits. Afterwards, I brought some more of them. Now, there are many rabbits living around here.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>With a smile, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, you really like rabbits.”</p>
        <p>While he was waiting in the grove, Wèi WúXiàn gave some thought to all he had learned, “I have seen and been informed about people I care the most. I really don’t care about other people or matters.</p>
        <p>“And, since I will soon recover my memories, there’s no need of asking too many questions. I’ll just go with the flow.</p>
        <p>“If Lán Zhàn wants to tell me about things I have forgotten, I’ll be all ears. On the other hand, if he doesn’t want to say anything, that’s all right by me.</p>
        <p>“However, if it turns out that Lán Zhàn is compelled to protect me, I will find other place to stay.”</p>
        <p>Following the white stone path, the two of them arrived at the meadow, where many fluffy white rabbits surrounded a big tree. Most of them were sleeping, while a few were moving around, with their three pink petals-like noses, and their long pinkish white ears that they fluttered from time to time.</p>
        <p>Amazed, Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “Wow! That’s quite a lot!”</p>
        <p>Wakened by the sound of Wèi WúXiàn’s voice, the rabbits began to gather around Lán WàngJī, some were climbing on his white boots, others were running around him, making one wondered why they were so excited.</p>
        <p>As they kept surrounding Lán WàngJī, some rabbits, standing on their hind legs, tried to climb further up on Lán WàngJī’s legs.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī picked up a rabbit and held it in his arms. With his slender fingers, he gently scratched the chin of the rabbit.</p>
        <p>In response to Lán WàngJī’s touch, the rabbit rested its long ears alongside its back, and narrowed its ruby-like eyes into small slits, apparently, very pleased by the stroke.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then caressed the head of the rabbit. However, the latter moved its head away from Wèi WúXiàn’s touch.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, this rabbit avoids me. It doesn’t like me at all.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī handed the white rabbit to him. And, with a happy smile, Wèi WúXiàn took the rabbit into his arms.</p>
        <p>Immediately, the rabbit began to toss and turn. Wèi WúXiàn tugged on its ears, then he was about to scratch the rabbit’s belly that Lán WàngJī restrained his hand.</p>
        <p>Interlacing his fingers with Wèi WúXiàn’s so to form a hand of ten fingers, Lán WàngJī guided Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, and they both gently stroked the back of the fluffy rabbit.</p>
        <p>Since he was accustomed to Lán WàngJī’s touch, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t find this physical contact unusual at all.</p>
        <p>Shortly, the white rabbit stopped wriggling, it rested peacefully in Wèi WúXiàn’s arms, and, once more, narrowed its eyes.</p>
        <p>In a soft voice, Lán WàngJī said, “Look, it likes you.”</p>
        <p>At that moment, a young boy, holding a basket, was coming towards them. The boy was wearing a GūsūLán uniform with a forehead ribbon without curl cloud motifs*.</p>
        <small>*Only the family members wear the ribbon with curl cloud motifs.</small>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, there is no need in letting many people know that you have lost your memories, since you will recover them soon.”</p>
        <p>“All right.” agreed Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Presently, the youngster came closer, and respectfully bowed to each of them in turn, “HánGuāng-Jūn. Wèi qiánbèi.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn caught a glimpse of carrots and cabbages inside the basket. While smiling, he remarked, “You came to feed the rabbits.”</p>
        <p>“Yes.” the young boy replied. Then, he picked up some carrots and cabbages, and handed them to Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn took the vegetables, and crouched down to feed the rabbits.</p>
        <p>The young boy said, “Wèi qiánbèi, SīZhuī shīxiōng* said that you are doing fine now.”</p>
        <small>*shīxiōng means senior (male) in any kind of disciplines (such as martial art).</small>
        <p>“Yes. I’m all right.” replied Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“That’s great!” the boy said. Then, in a shy way, he added, “Wèi qiánbèi, we were really worried about you. Please, be more careful in the future.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Am I not in good shape right now?”</p>
        <p>“Will you ...” the boy seemed to hesitate, then asked, “For our next month exam, will you be able to come and supervise us?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn glanced at Lán WàngJī, and the latter nodded his head, then Wèi WúXiàn replied, “I’ll be there.”</p>
        <p>The boy’s lips upturned into a smile. He then joyfully said, “We will work hard.”</p>
        <p>Then, the two of them fed the rabbits until they emptied the basket. And then, the young boy bowed, picked up his basket and off he went.</p>

        <br />
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn sat down on the grass, raised his head and looked at Lán WàngJī, he smiled, then he said, “Lán Zhàn, the young GūsūLán’s disciples are well mannered. That young boy was very polite even to me, an evil heretic.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī slightly frowned and said, “Wèi Yīng, you are not an evil heretic.” He then held out his hand to help Wèi WúXiàn stand up.</p>
        <p>This time, Wèi WúXiàn was conscious of an intimate sensation produced while Lán WàngJī was holding his hand.</p>
        <p>Then, he remembered, “Lán Zhàn, don’t you dislike touching other people?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī looked straight in Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes and said, “You are precious to me.”</p>
        <p>Besides what Lán WàngJī said to him, Wèi WúXiàn was mostly dazzled by Lán WàngJī’s gorgeous eyes; the golden irises of Lán WàngJī’s eyes were sparkling like a myriad of tiny little stars in the sky.</p>
        <p>He said, “That’s right. We both live together. Is it in that room named Jingshi where we live?”</p>
        <p>“Yes” replied Lán WàngJī, “Do you want to have a look at the room once more?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn replied, “Yes, why not. Anyway, right now, we don’t have anything else to do.”</p>
        <p>As he began to move forward, his leg failed to follow. This was due to not only because his legs went numb while he was squatting to feed the rabbits, but also because of Lán WàngJī’s words, (“You are precious to me.”), were still rumbling inside his head, making him sluggish.</p>
        <p>As he was about to fall, Lán WàngJī caught him just in time.</p>
        <p>“I had been crouching for too long, and my legs have gone numb.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī slightly knitted his brow and said, “You have an injury on your leg, which was caused by a sword. Apparently, it is not completely healed.”</p>
        <p>Surprised, Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “Really?! I am not at all aware of my own injury. GūsūLán’s ointment for wounds is really effective.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll carry you... on my back.” Lán WàngJī was about to say: I’ll carry you in my arms. However, afraid that he would shock Wèi WúXiàn, Lán WàngJī substituted the words ‘in my arms’ with ‘on my back’.</p>
        <p>Putting his words into action, Lán WàngJī bent down in order to let Wèi WúXiàn get on his back.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn intuitively felt that if he refused to get on his back, Lán WàngJī was capable of doing something else even more embarrassing, in order to carry him.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Wèi WúXiàn was really curious to see how Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù’s disciples would react when they would see Lán WàngJī giving him a piggyback ride back to Jingshi.</p>
        <p>Amused by the eventual priceless expression they might wear on their faces, Wèi WúXiàn got on Lán WàngJī’s back while saying, “Carry me, then.”</p>
        <p>After holding Wèi WúXiàn firmly on his back, Lán WàngJī began to walk slowly.</p>
        <p>Without seeing Lán WàngJī’s expression, Wèi WúXiàn felt that Lán WàngJī’s mood had changed, thinking that maybe he didn’t want to carry him at all.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, put me down. Don’t you think that it’s weird to carry me on your back?” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “You once carried me on your back when we were teenagers.”</p>
        <p>“Did I really do that? I don’t remember.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “It is true. You have just forgotten about it”.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Lán WàngJī carried Wèi WúXiàn until they arrived at their dwelling. And, despite the unusual sight they both were exhibiting, every disciple they had met on their way respectfully saluted them without being shocked.</p>
        <p>Inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn remarked, “GūsūLán sect has still adhered to their strict rules.”</p>
        <p>Once inside the Jingshi, Lán WàngJī made Wèi WúXiàn to sit on a chair, then went to fetch some ointment.</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī returned with the salve, Wèi WúXiàn remarked, “HánGuāng-Jūn, your temperament has changed a lot.”</p>
        <p>“Really? What has changed in me, for instance?” he asked.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn pointed his finger at a white guqin, which was laid on a low table, and said, “I was wondering, did you change your guqin? I remember that you used to have a black one.”</p>
        <p>Knelt in front Wèi WúXiàn,  Lán WàngJī replied while rolling up Wèi WúXiàn’s trouser leg, “That guqin is not mine. It’s yours.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn wasn’t sure of which fact was more surprising; was it because the white guqin actually belonged to him, or because Lán WàngJī crouched down on one knee in front him, for the sake of applying the ointment on his leg?</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, there’s no need for you to do that. I’m fine, I’m really fine.” implored Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī took no heed of his request. He held Wèi WúXiàn’s calf, applied the salve upon the spot of the wound, then he began to massage the area of the injury.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then took a look at his leg. There was no trace of the injury or scar, just a small red blotch.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then gather his spiritual power into his fingers until some blue light began to emit from his fingertips, then, he softly pressed on the blotch.</p>
        <p>As a result, the ointment quickly melted and got absorbed into Wèi WúXiàn’s skin.</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī carried on rubbing the blotch, a warm sensation rose and rapidly spread through the whole limb, gradually acting as an aphrodisiac on Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>He began to move his leg from side to side, up and down, back and forth, in order to escape Lán WàngJī’s massage.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then held Wèi WúXiàn’s calf tight, looked at him, and, in deep voice, he said, “Wèi Yīng, stop waggling your leg.”</p>
        <p>As he was at the same time looking and listening to Lán WàngJī who knelt in front of him, Wèi WúXiàn was stunned by a strong feeling of déjà vu. He at once stopped moving his leg.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī resumed the massage, then, when he finished with the red blotch, he moved on massaging the whole lower leg.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, you become more friendly now.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Really?” he said.</p>
        <p>“Yes, of course.” Wèi WúXiàn said, “You went out of your way to look for my flute. Didn’t you dislike my using the demonic power the most?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī suddenly stopped moving his hands, looked Wèi WúXiàn in the eye, and, in sincere tone, he said, “Wèi Yīng, back then, I was wrong.”</p>
        <p>Dumbfounded, Wèi WúXiàn was thrown off balance.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī carried on, “ A swordplay and a demonic power are both decent methods. It all depends on how the cultivator makes use of them. I should not have tried so blindly to stop you.”</p>
        <p>“You were not wrong.” hurriedly said Wèi WúXiàn, “ What you have said was right. Demonic power can progressively damage your mind and soul. I should not carelessly use it.”</p>
        <p>After a short pause, he resumed, “If I carry on using my demonic power, it will eventually backfire on me.”</p>
        <p>“That will not happen. I will protect you.” vowed Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn blushed at Lán WàngJī’s words. He then quickly changed the topic of their conversation, “How did you find Chénqíng? Zéwú-Jūn said that it was also carried away by the flood.”</p>
        <p>“Chénqíng resonated in response to WàngJī’s spiritual notes.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“Eh?” Wèi WúXiàn was confused. Why would his flute vibrate with the notes of Lán WàngJī’s guqin?</p>
        <p>However, he could not keep on wondering on the subject because Lán WàngJī had resumed massaging his leg.</p>
        <p>Rolling the trouser leg further up, Lán WàngJī massaged Wèi WúXiàn’s leg upward to his thigh.</p>
        <p>Watching Lán WàngJī, it appeared to Wèi WúXiàn that Lán WàngJī was very focused on his task as though it was the most important thing to him.</p>
        <p>Finally, Lán WàngJī was done with the massage. He slightly lifted Wèi WúXiàn’s leg to see if the ointment had been completely absorbed.</p>
        <p>Satisfied, Lán WàngJī put down Wèi WúXiàn’s leg, and unfolded the trouser leg.</p>
        <p>Honestly speaking, Wèi WúXiàn felt that his leg became more numb than it initially was. In addition, he was now in an oblivious state.</p>
        <p>“Do you want to have a closer look at the guqin?” asked Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Still in a daze, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “What did you say?”</p>
        <p>“I said, do you want to see your guqin.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“My guqin? Oh! Yes, I do.” Wèi WúXiàn finally woke up from his stupor. He took support from an adjacent table to stand up, then walked quickly towards the guqin while doing his best not to stumble.</p>
        <p>It was an exquisite seven-string guqin, slightly finer than the usual width of a guqin, and immaculate white like a blanket of snow lay on the top of the mountains.</p>
        <p>Engraved on the body of the guqin, in blue and large characters, was the word ‘WúXiàn’.</p>
        <p>With his name carved on the white guqin, Wèi WúXiàn was now convinced that it was his.</p>
        <p>“May I try it?” he asked.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī nodded, and said, “It belongs to you.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn sat on the low bench reserved for that purpose, and began to play a gentle melody. When he finished, he asked, “How was it?”</p>
        <p>With Lán WàngJī’s eyes of a sea of stars faintly shone golden light, Wèi WúXiàn was once more captivated, being unable to take his eyes off of him.</p>
        <p>With a faint smile, Lán WàngJī replied, “It was perfect.”</p>
        <p>“It did not occur to me that I know how to play guqin.” remarked Wèi WúXiàn, “I learned how to play it when I was twelve years old.”</p>
        <p>“I know.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Is it you who gave it to me?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“It is a very luxurious guqin. It must have cost a fortune.” he remarked.</p>
        <p>“You deserve it.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, you are so awesome now. Since when you become so straightforward?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“I learned it from you.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“What else did you learn from me?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“Not to hold yourself from saying what you have in mind.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“That won’t do.” protested Wèi WúXiàn, “Currently, I am in my teenage years, so you have to behave like the teenager HánGuāng-Jūn that I am used to.”</p>
        <p>“OK.” he agreed.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then asked, “What do I usually do here, at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù? Copying several times the GūsūLán’s rules.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī shook his head in negation, then said, “You go for Night-Hunt*, and, on other occasions, you go out for fun.”</p>
        <small>*Night-Hunt is the usual activity that cultivators do; they suppress evil spirits and demons for the sake of the common people.</small>
        <p>“Going out for fun? Where?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“To many places.” Lán WàngJī replied.</p>
        <p>“For example?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“Currently, there is a place where we can go,” replied Lán WàngJī, “and have a lunch over there. Then, in afternoon, we can take a boat and sightsee the surrounding areas.”</p>
        <p>“Is there something special happening over there?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.</p>
        <p>“There is a Spring Festival.” he replied, “It is a local festival that is held every year in late spring, for ten days, in order to see off the spring.”</p>
        <p>“I’ve never heard of it before.” remarked Wèi WúXiàn, “Is it an event that has started in recent years?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.” he replied, “I’ll take you there, so you can see it for yourself.”</p>
        <p>Already excited, Wèi WúXiàn agreed, “Okay.”</p>

        <br />
        <p>Lán WàngJī went to the wardrobe and took out two sets of green clothes.</p>
        <p>Surprised, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Do we need to change our clothes?”</p>
        <p>“In that festival, everyone wear green.” Lán WàngJī replied, “We’ve been there before, so we already have the green clothes. ”</p>
        <p>“All right.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Then, he began to take off his clothes. However, halfway through, he felt that something was wrong. He cast a quick look at Lán WàngJī and saw that the latter was watching him. He suddenly felt embarrassed.</p>
        <p>“You can go behind the dressing screen to change your clothes.” suggested Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>With his face turned red, Wèi WúXiàn took his clothes, and quickly went behind the dressing screen.</p>
        <p>Inwardly, he suddenly began to wonder, “This is really weird. We are both males, naturally, there is nothing wrong to be in the same room to change clothes. So, why do I have to be behind the dressing screen?”</p>
        <p>He carried on thinking, “However, if the other person is none other than Lán Zhàn, somehow, it feels different.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then looked through the dressing screen, and saw that Lán WàngJī was facing the dressing screen on the other side. And, it appeared that he had already taken off his outer garments.</p>
        <p>Behind the dressing screen, Lán WàngJī’s silhouette appeared very tall, with broad shoulders and two firm and strong arms. </p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn got a sudden desire to see how Lán WàngJī looked like without his outer robes.</p>
        <p>However, he resisted and carried on changing clothes. And, when he finished, he came out and saw that Lán WàngJī had also finished dressing.</p>
        <p>The garments were very beautiful, and the colour was dark green, similar to a pine tree’s. Wèi WúXiàn had never seen him wearing green clothes before.</p>
        <p>He was so elegant, and, with his natural beauty, he was looking like a deity. Wèi WúXiàn could not help himself from blushing at his gorgeous appearance.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, your cheeks seem slightly red. Are you feeling sick?” asked Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly replied, “I’m feeling fine.” Then, he put a hand on his face, and inwardly said, “Indeed, my face is burning hot.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī turned his head away, and a faint and furtive smile appeared on his face. However, his smile disappeared so quickly that Wèi WúXiàn thought that he saw it wrong.</p>
        <p>“You have wrongly tied your waist-belt.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>He then got closer to Wèi WúXiàn, undid the waist-belt, then properly fastened it around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist, while a faint fragrance of sandalwood caressed Wèi WúXiàn’s nostrils.</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī finished tying his waist-belt, Wèi WúXiàn carefully looked at it, but failed to see any difference from what he had done before.</p>
        <p>However, he became aware of his own appearance; both of them were wearing the identical garments with the same embroidered motifs.</p>
        <p>“Your hair are a little bit messy.” remarked Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn quickly said, “I’ll tidy it myself.” Then, he hurried towards the dressing mirror.</p>
        <p>Upon reaching it, Wèi WúXiàn was shocked by his own reflection in the mirror.</p>
        <p>In a low voice, he said, “Lán Zhàn, Jiāng Chéng said that I once died. So, my current appearance once belonged to the person who summoned me.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī frowned when he heard the word ‘died’ from Wèi WúXiàn’s mouth.</p>
        <p>“This face is indeed different from my formal one.” he said, then turned his head to look at Lán WàngJī, “It seems like I am not the only one here who has changed, you have also changed a lot.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī walked towards Wèi WúXiàn, then stood behind him. They looked at each other in the mirror.</p>
        <p>In a deep voice, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you are still who you used to be, you definitely haven’t changed at all. As for, I haven’t changed either.”</p>
        <p>After a pause, he asked, “Should we go there on our swords?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn hesitantly replied, “Yes.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then fetched a cloak, and said, “Put this on.”</p>
        <p>As was his habit, Wèi WúXiàn just stretched his arms so Lán WàngJī could do it for him. So, he did. Then, he carried on putting the hood over Wèi WúXiàn’s head, and secured it by tying the laces in a knot.</p>
        <p>After a few moments, Wèi WúXiàn suddenly realised that he actually let Lán WàngJī put the cloak on him. Moreover, as they had stepped outside, he unconsciously held Lán WàngJī’s hand to get on Bìchén.</p>
        <p>And, right now, he was standing behind Lán WàngJī, and his eyes were on his broad back. He didn’t know where else to direct his gaze, or where to put his hands.</p>
        <p>“Hold me tight. We will be travelling against the wind.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn said, “In my entire life, I’ve never expected to hear the words ‘Hold me tight’ coming from Lán Zhàn’s mouth.”</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī saw that he hadn’t hold him yet, he took Wèi WúXiàn’s both hands, and made him wrap his arms around his waist.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn just gave up on thinking too much, and firmly held Lán WàngJī’s waist, then, Lán WàngJī set Bìchén in motion; they took off, flying high in the sky.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then began to wonder. “Does Lán Zhàn know that I can no longer, on my own, fly on the sword?”</p>
        <p>Then, he thought again, “Wait a minute! This can’t be the case, because my current body used to belong to someone else, and his spiritual power is not great. That might explain why Lán Zhàn has taken me to drive on his sword.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was lost in thought that he failed to admire the scenery as they flew by.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, what are you thinking about?” asked Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“I’m not thinking.” he denied.</p>
        <p>“We will soon fly across the Green Lake, then arrive in Caiyin Town.” said Lán WàngJī, then, he began to lower their altitude.</p>
        <p>“Is it in that town that the festival is taking place?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” he replied.</p>
        <p>By the time they reached the lake, they were flying at an altitude of few metres above water. At this short distance, they could clearly admire the reflection of the sky gleaming on the surface of the lake, with some thin ripples here and there.</p>
        <p>“Is this the Green Lake?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“Are there water ghouls in this lake?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.</p>
        <p>“No. They have been suppressed.” replied Lán WàngJī, “Two years ago, you have improved the properties of the spiritual nets. This improvement has made the nets be more efficient and convenient underwater, and helped to get rid of the water ghouls.”</p>
        <p>“Wow! I really did that!” he exclaimed.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” replied Lán WàngJī, then, he praised him, which made him feel happy.</p>
        <p>So, Wèi WúXiàn began to talk about the ingenious ideas he had, then carried on narrating his prowess in hunting demons and monsters. Even though Lán WàngJī, from time to time, only replied in monosyllables, he just kept on talking.</p>
        <p>Although he had already heard most of what Wèi WúXiàn was saying, Lán WàngJī just kept on listening. In fact, he never got tired of hearing Wèi WúXiàn speaking.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn gradually hugged Lán WàngJī more and more tighter. When he got tired from talking too much, he put his head against Lán WàngJī’s back, and, progressively, fell asleep.</p>
        <p>Reaching the town of Caiyin, Lán WàngJī drove his sword on the outskirts of the town, found a quiet place, then, he landed.</p>
        <p>He then held Wèi WúXiàn in his arms, and inwardly said, “Indeed, he has fallen asleep.” However, he didn’t want to wake him up.</p>
        <p>He chose a clean and large rock, sat down, and look at Wèi WúXiàn who was soundly sleeping in his arms.</p>
        <p>Only up to now that Lán WàngJī felt a little bit at ease.</p>
        <p>He was in agony for two days of the search, then he had to wait another two days for Wèi WúXiàn to wake up.</p>
        <p>When he finally woke up, Lán WàngJī received a great shock, because Wèi WúXiàn had forgotten all about them living as a couple.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Wèi WúXiàn even said that he wanted to go back to Lotus Piers, when Jiāng Chéng told him that they both had been living and doing everything together.</p>
        <p>Luckily for Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn was still able to read his facial expression, and all his little habits had not changed. So, thankfully, he was still his Wèi Yīng.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī slightly lifted Wèi WúXiàn’s chin, and deeply kissed him.</p>
        <p>Being unconsciously familiar with Lán WàngJī’s touch and scent, Wèi WúXiàn parted his lips, and let Lán WàngJī’s tongue penetrate into his mouth.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī kissed Wèi WúXiàn softly, savouring the sweetness and softness of his tongue. And, at the same, releasing all his anxiety and worries, all his panic and torment of these past four days.</p>
        <p>Then, when he finished kissing him, Lán WàngJī slightly bit Wèi WúXiàn’s lower lip, and the latter let out a “hmm” sound, which set fire down in Lán WàngJī’s manhood.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, you came back a bit earlier. Hurry up, hold me. I am yours.” Wèi WúXiàn once said that to him.</p>
        <p>And, right now, he wanted to make love to him here, at this place, at this instant. He wanted to see his eyes gleaming with lust, and hear him moaning in pleasure. His urge of holding him was way too strong to bear.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī took a deep breath, then, he pecked Wèi WúXiàn on the cheek and lips, and then, he put him on the rock, placed Wèi WúXiàn’s head on his lap, and began to meditate in order to calm himself down.</p>
        <p>After a while, Wèi WúXiàn slowly opened his eyes. While he was sleeping, he had a strange dream. In his dream, Lán WàngJī and he were living in seclusion.</p>
        <p>Both of them were on a boat, and Lán WàngJī, wearing a raincoat, cast a fishing net in the lake.</p>
        <p>On their way back home, they let the current push the boat. Lán WàngJī sat on the bow of the boat, looking at Wèi WúXiàn who was playing some notes on Chénqíng.</p>
        <p>As he finished recalling his dream, Wèi WúXiàn now looked at Lán WàngJī in green garments, and, with the one in a raincoat, in his dream, he saw in front of him the two images of Lán WàngJī overlapping each other.</p>
        <p>He chuckled.</p>
        <p>“What makes you chortle?” Lán WàngJī asked.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn sat up, adjusted his robes, and failed to notice that his head was resting on Lán WàngJī’s lap, he replied, “I was just looking how handsome you are. I also dreamed of you.”</p>
        <p>“Did you sleep well?” he asked.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn noticed that the way Lán WàngJī looked at him was slightly different than before. He got puzzled.</p>
        <p>However, he simply replied, “I slept well.” then he realised, “It’s strange that I easily fell asleep. Didn’t you say that I was in a coma for few days?”</p>
        <p>“You usually don’t wake up so early in the morning.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“Let’s go to the town.” Lán WàngJī carried on, “What do you want to eat?”</p>
        <p>“We’ve already arrived. What is this place?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“This is a village named Cross-Path.” Lán WàngJī replied.</p>
        <p>“What an interesting name.” Wèi WúXiàn remarked.</p>
    </div>

        <br />
        <p>As they arrive in town, Lán WàngJī chose a fine dining restaurant that served Sichuan cuisine, and asked for an upstairs private room.</p>
        <p>A waiter came over and handed them a menu.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī took the menu and gave it to Wèi WúXiàn, he said, “Order whatever you want to eat.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn looked at the menu, then, to his heart’s content, he ordered, “I’ll have one dish of steamed glutinous rice dumplings, one dish of boiled pak choi, and one dish of bamboo shoot soup.”</p>
        <p>“Let me have a look at the seasonal vegetables.” he carried on, “Add one dish of stir-fried garland chrysanthemum with peas. And, finally, one dish of chicken with bean curd, and two dipping sauces, one spicy and the other non-spicy.”</p>
        <p>He raised his head and noticed Lán WàngJī’s facial expression, he asked, “Why are you looking so happy?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī suppressed a faint smile*, and said to the waiter, “I’ll have one dish of diced fish in chilli sauce, one dish of thinly sliced beef, one dish of diced spicy chicken, and one dish of beef in sour soup.”</p>
        <small>*Lán WàngJī smiles because Wèi WúXiàn mostly orders green dishes (GūsūLán’s usual dishes), while he actually loves spicy food (he is considerate of Lán WàngJī).</small>
        <p>“Will you be able to finish all this?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“I don’t mind if I can’t finish all the dishes.” Lán WàngJī replied, “You can eat them as well.”</p>
        <p>Then, he said to the waiter, “Let the cook know that we would like to have a small portion of every dish.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then gazed at Lán WàngJī’s profile. His awareness of being attracted to him gradually grew. And, the more he spent time with Lán WàngJī, the greater this feeling became.</p>
        <p>After eating, they went for a stroll on the streets.</p>
        <p>Although everyone was wearing green clothes, their appearances were the most outstanding. People were stopping to cast a glance at them.</p>
        <p>As they kept on walking, they soon saw a large group of people queueing in front of a shop.</p>
        <p>Curious, Wèi WúXiàn hurried over there to have a look, and found out that it was a bookshop.</p>
        <p>Then, he returned and asked, “Lán Zhàn, why those people are standing in a queue in front of the bookshop?”</p>
        <p>“Because today is the released day of a popular illustrated book.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“What kind of an illustrated book is so popular?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“Do you want to see it for yourself?” Lán WàngJī asked.</p>
        <p>“Not all.” Wèi WúXiàn replied, “Otherwise, we will have to wait in such a long queue. Let’s go somewhere else instead. Didn’t you plan for us to sightsee on a boat?”</p>
        <p>“There’s no need for queueing.” replied Lán WàngJī, “I have priorly placed an order.”</p>
        <p>Then, he led Wèi WúXiàn all the way to the front door of the bookshop, and showed a red card to the shop assistant.</p>
        <p>The red card attracted attention of many people in the queue. And Wèi WúXiàn could see in their eyes a burning jealousy.</p>
        <p>After examining the card, the shop assistant told Lán WàngJī to wait for a moment, then he entered the shop.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then cast a look inside the shop, and saw many bookshelves densely filled with books. And, it seemed that all those books were of the same kind.</p>
        <p>He also noticed that the staff were busy from picking up books from the selves and packing them.</p>
        <p>While he was impatiently waiting, Wèi WúXiàn overheard a conversation of people next to him.</p>
        <p>“Really? Here I was thinking that he has turned over a new leaf.” said one of them.</p>
        <p>“How can he change? People don’t change their way so easily.” said second person.</p>
        <p>“Yílíng Lǎozǔ has done so many evil deeds. How can you believe that he has changed?” said the third.</p>
        <p>“He has even influenced HánGuāng-Jūn, this is just unbelievable.”</p>
        <p>“What are you guys talking about? What did Yílíng Lǎozǔ do this time?”</p>
        <p>“Have you not heard the rumour that is circulating around?”</p>
        <p>“A few days ago, in the upper reaches of Han River, it had rained just a little bit. However, Yílíng Lǎozǔ mobilised a large troop, and forced the villagers from Wěishàn to leave their village.</p>
        <p>“Then, he blew the village’s dam, inundating the entire village in order to diverge the flood of Han River.</p>
        <p>“Fortunately, the villagers had run away quickly, otherwise, they would have been drowned because of his actions.”</p>
        <p>“I heard that many people had died.”</p>
        <p>“Regardless of whether people had died or not, he had definitely flooded their ancestral graveyard. He either uses people’s graveyards to summon corpses, or floods them. Why he always has to destroyed other people’s ancestral graveyards.”</p>
        <p>“Still, HánGuāng-Jūn does not do anything about it.”</p>
        <p>“Don’t you know that people are the product of their environment. Since he has spent so many years with Yílíng Lǎozǔ, he also becomes like him. I’m afraid that HánGuāng-Jūn is just a self-righteous person.</p>
        <p>“And GūsūLán sect just yearns to possess the devices that Yílíng Lǎozǔ invents from time to time.”</p>
        <p>“I heard that it was HánGuāng-Jūn who destroyed the dam. So, he is also to be blamed for the killing of those people.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn clenched his fists, while, inwardly saying, “I thought that my heart was as hard as a rock, that nothing will shake me up. I was wrong.”</p>
        <p>Then, once again, Jiāng Chéng’s account began to echo inside his head, “Lán WàngJī and you become inseparable. Lán WàngJī protects you because people still hate you.”</p>
        <p>“If the rumour was only about me,” said Wèi WúXiàn inwardly, “I would not care in the slightest. However, I can’t tolerate the fact that Lán Zhàn has been bad-mouthed, as well.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn didn’t know how to face his uncertain future, or why was he still by Lán WàngJī’s side?</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng.” Lán WàngJī’s voice sounded to his ears as if it came from a far distance, like in a dream.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn turned his head and noted that Lán WàngJī was looking at him with all the kindness he had.</p>
        <p>“Let’s go” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Then, he held Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, and led him away from the bookshop.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then gently freed his hand from Lán WàngJī’s.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, don’t mind what they said, because it’s not the truth.” he said.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn let out a dispirited “uh-huh” sound. His devastated mood and racing thoughts remained unchanged until they got on the boat.</p>
        <p>There was one crucial question that he had opted to suppress so far. However, right now, he could no longer prevent it from emerging.</p>
        <p>Why people still hated him despite the issue of the last survivors of the Wēn clan had been settled, and despite he had already destroyed the Tiger Talisman?</p>
        <p>His decision to protect those people from the last branch of the Wēn clan would never be understood by others. His ruthless methods used during Shooting Star campaign would always stay in their memories. How could he be accepted by them?</p>
        <p>And, why was he staying with Lán WàngJī?</p>
        <p>Was there no place for him in this vast world?</p>
        <p>In a gentle voice, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you haven’t harmed anyone in that village. The relocation has already been settled between the villagers and the authorities---”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn interrupted Lán WàngJī, “Lán Zhàn, I know what kind of person I am, and what I won’t never do.”</p>
        <p>With a derisive smile, he carried on, “It’s just that other people don’t think that way.”</p>
        <p>“You never care about what others think.” remarked Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“But I care about what you think.” he unconsciously uttered those words.</p>
        <p>They were both, at once, surprised by what he just said; Lán WàngJī was surprise because Wèi WúXiàn had completely forgotten how they cared for each other, while Wèi WúXiàn didn’t understand why he said those words.</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī laughed; this was a very rare occasion to see him laughing, that Wèi WúXiàn was absolutely amazed, and his heart began to beat rapidly.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you once said ‘What is right or wrong is decided by oneself. One’s reputation is judged by others.’ So, you don’t care about the rest. So, neither I.”</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, you laughed.” said Wèi WúXiàn while laughing as well.</p>
        <p>“You, too.” he replied.</p>
        <p>The swaying movement of the boat gradually swept away Wèi WúXiàn’s melancholic thoughts.</p>
        <p>“I have ordered from the bookshop a collection of books that you wanted to have. Do you want to read them?” asked Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” he replied.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then took out from his sleeve a set of books fastened with a red string.</p>
        <p>On the cover, there was a picture of an one-eyed young man clad in red, wearing black boots and a sword on his waist, and a young Taoist in white robes, with a rain hat hanging on his back.</p>
        <p>“A King Demon And A Taoist.” read Wèi WúXiàn while undoing the red string, “By the title of this book, it is indeed something that I would like to read.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, of course.” remarked Lán WàngJī, “You have already read the previous volumes.”</p>
        <p>There were four volumes in total, and Wèi WúXiàn took the first follow-up volume, read the first few pages, then said, “Yes, indeed. Somehow, the story seems familiar to me.”</p>
        <p>“You usually read in your spare time.” Lán WàngJī said.</p>
        <p>Then, he placed a plate of roasted melon seeds and a plate of fresh fruit close to Wèi WúXiàn, and then, he began to make some tea, while thinking that if the story had left a vague impression on Wèi WúXiàn, maybe it was because he had read it so many times before.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn finished reading the first book, and was convinced that he knew not only the plot but also the characters of the story.</p>
        <p>After carefully reading the whole second book, he felt somehow a resemblance to a character of the story, and yet, there were also some differences between the character and him. And, he had an intuition on the fate of the character.</p>
        <p>He then quickly read the third book. Upon finishing it, his hand was already on the last one, stroking its cover. However, he did not dare to open it.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn!” he called out.</p>
        <p>“I’m right here.” said Lán WàngJī while serving him another cup of tea.</p>
        <p>“Does this story has a happy ending?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“Yes, I think so.” he replied, “The author of these books never writes tragic ending stories.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then felt relieved, and opened the last volume.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī summoned WàngJī, then, he began gently to strum on the guqin, playing a serene melody.</p>
        <p>After a while, Wèi WúXiàn finished and closed the book. He was very excited, and, once more, he began to wonder, “In the story, the character’s situation has some similarities with my own. We both, no doubt, have also a similar personality.”</p>
        <p>He carried on, “A warrior is always by himself, walking his path alone. Luckily, the character in the story has someone, who never leaves his side.</p>
        <p>“This kind of bond between two people is so heart-warming, making one feel envious of their relationship.</p>
        <p>“If Lán Zhàn and I could also be like this...”</p>

    </div>

        <br />
        <p>After having such wish in his mind, Wèi WúXiàn could not help but cast a furtive look in Lán WàngJī’s direction.</p>
        <p>At that precise moment, Lán WàngJī also looked at him, and his look seemed to asked Wèi WúXiàn if he had finished reading the books.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn suppressed his thought, then asked, “Lán Zhàn, is there another set of the volumes coming up?”</p>
        <p>“There is no more follow-up, because the story is finished.” replied Lán WàngJī, “Other volumes are in Jìngshì. The set of books that you just finished reading is the final one.”</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, you seem to know everything about this story.” he remarked.</p>
        <p>“Because we also have a full version of the story that was previously published without illustration. So, I have read that version with you.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Really?” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, while trying to control his heartbeat that had suddenly quickened, “Then, tell me which passage of the story I like the most.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī put aside WàngJī, walked and stood behind Wèi WúXiàn, leaned over him, and then, he opened the third book on a chapter named ‘Sailing In The Sea Of Ghosts’.</p>
        <p>His voice was low and clear, echoing in Wèi WúXiàn’s ears, “Wèi Yīng, as far as I am concerned, you are my infinite view. Even when I am in peril, you always stay by my side. What is important in my eyes is you, not who are you.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn began to wonder, “It seems to me that I have heard Lán Zhàn’s voice uttering these very same words before.”</p>
        <p>Then, he could no longer controlled his heartbeat, since his heart was now pounding as though it was about to burst out of his chest.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī called out, “Wèi Yīng.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn turned his head towards Lán WàngJī, who was still leaning over him, and, immediately, he felt as if he was swallowed by his golden eyes flickering like a sea of starts. Moreover, it seemed like he had some difficulty in breathing properly.</p>
        <p>“What?” he managed to ask.</p>
        <p>“This is your most favourite passage of the story.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“My what? Oh!” he then collected himself, “Yes, I like this passage the most, it’s my favourite.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn forced himself to calm down in order to conceal his palpitating heart from Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>He then asked, “What happened afterwards?”</p>
        <p>“Afterwards, they became a couple, and lived together for the rest of their lives.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“They became a couple?” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Yes, they became a couple.” Lán WàngJī replied, “You don’t like it?”</p>
        <p>“Come again?” he said.</p>
        <p>“Does it displease you, the fact that two men became couple?” Lán WàngJī repeated the question.</p>
        <p>“Why should I be displeased?” he replied, “As long as two people like each other, their gender does not matter at all.”</p>
        <p>“Uh-huh.” agreed Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Who exactly is Bai WuXiang?” asked Wèi WúXiàn, “Has he been defeated in the end?”</p>
        <p>“You never like me to spoil the plot.” he replied, “Wait until we return in Jìngshì, so you can read it for yourself.”</p>
        <p>“All right, then. I’ll read it when we get back home.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Soon after, however, he asked yet another question, “Are they both safe and sound?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī wore a concerned expression, he replied, “After defeating Bai WuXiang, the main character’s magical power was exhausted, which caused his body to become transparent.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was chocked.</p>
        <p>“The character says to his partner:” said Lán WàngJī while sitting in front of Wèi WúXiàn and looking straight into his eyes, “I know everything about you; your bravery, your despair, your kindness, your pain, your grievance, your abhorrence, your cleverness and your foolishness.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī spoke very slow, however, Wèi WúXiàn’s heart was beating fast. Here we go again with the uncontrollable heartbeat.</p>
        <p>“He knows everything about me?” wondered Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Like the characters in the story,” he carried on, “I feel that I was completely defeated, a perfect failure covered with blood, rebuked and criticised by others, being extremely desperate and having no other choice but to cry.</p>
        <p>“However, Lán Zhàn has the memories of these past twenty years. So, he knows everything that happened during these years, including everything about me.</p>
        <p>“Had I once been in an unpleasant situation in which it was difficult to escape? In his eyes, how does Lán Zhàn see me?”</p>
        <p>Then, all of a sudden, he asked, “Lán Zhàn, what do you know about me?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī was dumbfounded, he did not expect Wèi WúXiàn to ask him this question.</p>
        <p>However, since the question had been asked, Lán WàngJī didn’t have other option but to give an answer. And, since Lán WàngJī had always kept something that was very painful for him, and very concerned about it, he could no longer keep it hidden deep down in his heart.</p>
        <p>“I know that you gave away your golden core to Jiāng WǎnYín*.” he replied, “Wèi Yīng, was it painful when your golden core had been cut off?”</p>
        <small>*Jiāng WǎnYín is Jiāng Chéng’s given name.</small>
        <p>After asking this question, Lán WàngJī immediately regretted it, because he didn’t want to bring this awful memory to Wèi WúXiàn’s mind.</p>
        <p>This time it was Wèi WúXiàn’s turn to be dumbfounded. He was in fact worried that he would learn something unbearable about himself. However, he did not expect that Lán WàngJī would be worried about his pain during the surgery.</p>
        <p>He quickly collected himself, “You also know about that.” he calmly said, “ It didn’t hurt at all. I believe you have heard of Wēn Qíng*, the divine physician. She had made a very powerful anaesthetic.”</p>
        <smal>*Wēn Qíng is the leader of the last branch of Wēn clan.</smal>
        <p>Lán WàngJī somehow expected this kind of answer. He abruptly stood up and went to stand by the window, facing outside while he remained silent. He didn’t want to let Wèi WúXiàn notice that he was upset.</p>
        <p>“He said that it hadn’t hurt at all.” said Lán WàngJī inwardly, “While, in fact, it had hurt a lot. Even after all these years, he still doesn’t want to talk about it openly.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn felt uneasy as he noted that Lán WàngJī’s expression had changed. He walked up to him, and stood by his side.</p>
        <p>With a timid smile, he said, “Lán Zhàn, you haven’t finished telling what happened to the characters in the story. You said that the main character’s body became transparent. Did he still live together with his partner?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī pulled himself together, then turned his head towards Wèi WúXiàn, while his eyes reflecting the outside scenery of the beautiful lake and mountains.</p>
        <p>Back then, as a teenager, he had deeply fallen in love with him, and, ever since Wèi WúXiàn had become his obsession.</p>
        <p>Looking into his eyes, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, although all good things must come to an end, I will never be parted from you.”</p>
        <p>“`Huh?” Wèi WúXiàn was puzzled.</p>
        <p>“The main character only departed for one year, and, afterwards, he returned to his partner’s side, because, before his departure, he said and swore to him: ‘Enjoyable experiences cannot last for ever, however, I will never be parted from you.’.” said Lán WàngJī while still looking at Wèi WúXiàn with his charming eyes.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn felt as though Lán WàngJī was saying those words to him.</p>
        <p>Then, like a flashback, it seemed to him that he was in Jìngshì under the warm light of a candle, and Lán WàngJī was reading this passage for you.</p>
        <p>“This is really going to kill me.” said Wèi WúXiàn inwardly.</p>
        <p>He could no longer resist, and, slowly, he moved closer and closer to Lán WàngJī, so close that he could see his own reflection in his golden eyes.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the boat shook violently, and Wèi WúXiàn lost his balance, and when he was about to fall backwards, Lán WàngJī caught him in the nick of time.</p>
        <p>Outside of the cabin, they could hear the boatman shouting and cursing. Apparently, another boat accidentally bumped into theirs.</p>
        <p>After he was done shouting to his counterpart, the boatman got closer to the cabin, and apologised to them.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī opened the curtain and went outside. He seemed to have said to the boatman: “It doesn’t matter.” However, the sound of the water covered the rest of their conversation.</p>
        <p>“Just now, was I about to kiss Lán Zhàn?” Wèi WúXiàn was in state of panic.</p>
        <p>Soon after, Wèi WúXiàn remembered the strict curfew of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, and, not wanting Lán WàngJī to break the rules of his sect, he suggested that they should end their sightseeing and go back home.</p>
        <p>On their way home, they saw a young girl selling flowers. On the petals of those vivid and colourful flowers, there were some tiny droplets of water, which enhanced flowers’ natural colours.</p>
        <p>Moreover, one could smell a delicate fragrance coming from the basket that contained the flowers.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn picked up some magnolia and acacia flowers, then he raised Lán WàngJī’s hand so to take out the purse from his sleeve. His way of doing so was so natural that one could see that it was not the first time that he performed this action.</p>
        <p>Having the purse in his hand, Wèi WúXiàn then released that he had done something inappropriate. He blushed with embarrassment, and returned the purse in Lán WàngJī’s sleeve.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then took out the purse, and handed it to him, he said, “You can have it.”</p>
        <p>At once, any trace of bashfulness disappeared from Wèi WúXiàn’s face, he paid for the flowers, then tied them into a bouquet.</p>
        <p>The mix of the white magnolia with the red acacia was attractively pleasing to the eye.</p>
        <p>“It’s for you.” Wèi WúXiàn gave the bouquet to Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī took the bouquet, and, in a deep voice, he said, “Thanks.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn no longer bothered himself wondering why Lán WàngJī had changed to the point that he would easily accept something from him.</p>
        <p>Deep down, he was in fact delighted that Lán WàngJī accepted the bouquet. As a result of being in a good mood, his way of walking became more lively.</p>
        <p>He began to toss up Lán WàngJī’s purse into the air, while noting that the pale blue purse was kept with great care.</p>
        <p>He also noticed that the purse was made with a high quality fabric, as well as was the white silk yarn used for the embroidery. However, the embroidered shape was curled into a white ball; it was hard to tell what it was.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, what does this embroidered shape represent?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“It is a curl cloud.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was agape, however, he praised the work despite himself, “It’s very unique, it has some feature and style. The person who made this purse has some skills.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī made no comment, he just smiled*.</p>
        <small>*Apparently, it’s Wèi WúXiàn himself who makes the purse.</small>

        <br />
        <p>Before getting on Bìchén, Lán WàngJī put the cloak on Wèi WúXiàn, and the latter, no longer wanting to bother with this matter, just took it as a normal act from Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>On their way to the town, they had travelled against the headwind, however, on their way back, it was a tailwind.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī let Wèi WúXiàn stand in front, and, in a natural way, he wrapped his arms around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist, initiating him to lean against his torso.</p>
        <p>The exotic, sweet and warm scent of sandalwood coming from Lán WàngJī also encircled Wèi WúXiàn, and the latter began to hear the sound of his own heartbeat quickened.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then began to move his hands aimlessly. However, when his hands were about to touch Lán WàngJī, he quickly retracted them.</p>
        <p>He wanted to touch him, but he didn’t dare to do so.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was aware that Lán WàngJī valued him, treating him very kindly. However, he didn’t want to speculate on how much his ‘esteem’ was, and whether his way of ‘treating him’ was what he was thinking of.</p>
        <p>Never before had he experienced such unsettled feeling, he didn’t know what to do, he feared that it was just his own fantasy, that he was overly confident.</p>
        <p>“Shall I touch his hand?” wondered Wèi WúXiàn, “If Lán Zhàn avoids my touching him, I will just feign ignorance.” after a pause, he resumed, “Somehow, I feel that Lán Zhàn won’t dodge my touch.”</p>
        <p>“Throughout the entire day, Lán Zhàn himself has been touching me.” he carried on, “Hold on! It sounds a little bit weird to use the word ‘touching’ when it comes to Lán Zhàn.”</p>
        <p>In the morning, Lán WàngJī carried him on his back until they reached Jìngshì, then he massaged his leg, he adjusted his waist belt, and he even held his hand and took him away from the bookshop.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn recalled every single action, expression and word of Lán WàngJī, then he resolved to touch him by pretending that it was an accident.</p>
        <p>Determined as he was, Wèi WúXiàn began to moved his hand bit by bit towards Lán WàngJī’s hand.</p>
        <p>It seemed to him as though the wind had stopped blowing, that he had held his own breath.</p>
        <p>Then, his fingers slightly touched Lán WàngJī’s hand. However, he also brushed something hard, and, at once, his curiosity took over his anxiety, he held and raised Lán WàngJī’s hand so to have a look.</p>
        <p>It was a beautiful white bracelet, which reflecting some light on its surface.</p>
        <p>“I’ve never seen you wearing a bracelet before.” he remarked.</p>
        <p>In a soft tone, Lán WàngJī said, “It’s you who gave it to me.”</p>
        <p>Overjoyed, Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “I gave it to you? That’s pretty cool! It seems that I’m not staying in GūsūLán sect as a freeloader, after all.”</p>
        <p>There was something else on Lán WàngJī’s wrist; a knotted hair, and Wèi WúXiàn could straight way tell that there was two different hair: Lán WàngJī’s and his.</p>
        <p>He said, “Hair?” deliberately avoid to say knotted hair.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” Lán WàngJī replied, “The hair is a mix of yours and mine.” Lán WàngJī also avoid to say knotted hair* because he didn’t want to shock Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <small>*During the traditional Chinese wedding, the newlyweds cut off a lock of their hair, then tie it into a knot. In other words, Wèi WúXiàn gives Lán WàngJī his knotted hair as a token of their union.</small>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then pondered, “Why the stuff I gave Lán Zhàn are somewhat ambiguous?! Could it be that my own self in these past years likes Lán Zhàn as well?”</p>
        <p>He carried on, “That could be plausible, because Lán Zhàn is kind, as well as handsome, so it is hard not to like him.”</p>
        <p>He turned his head so to look at Lán WàngJī. “Indeed, Lán Zhàn is very handsome,” he said inwardly, “his eyebrows, his eyes, his nose and his lips are really beautiful. He is without a doubt the most good-looking man I’ve ever seen.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then noticed that Lán WàngJī had already put back the hand, which he was holding, on his waist. This time, however, Lán WàngJī took along Wèi WúXiàn’s hands, and wrapped them with his own hands.</p>
        <p>The feeling of being loved enveloped his whole body, making Wèi WúXiàn feel fully content and free to fly, like a bird, higher and higher.</p>
        <br />
        <p>--- --- ---</p>
        <br />
        <p>Back in Jìngshì, Lán WàngJī prepared all the necessities for a bath.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, this wooden bathtub is huge,” remarked Wèi WúXiàn while his fingers slightly tapping on the brim of the bathtub, “it’s large enough for two people to bathe in, for sure.”</p>
        <p>Then, “Good heavens! What did I just say?” he exclaimed inwardly, “That was careless of me to say those words. And, what Lán Zhàn is going to think of it?”</p>
        <p>However, Lán WàngJī remained silent.</p>
        <p>With his back facing Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn could not see his expression, nor did he dare to turn around and look at him.</p>
        <p>He nervously gulped, and said, “Lán Zhàn, go ahead.”</p>
        <p>“Do you want me to bathe before you?” Lán WàngJī calmly asked.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn quickly replied, “Yes, go ahead. I’ll go and wait outside.” Then, he dashed out of the room.</p>
        <p>Once outside, he began to release the tension he had felt, “Lán Zhàn’s tone was soft, but, at the same, it sounded frightening, it really scared me.”</p>
        <p>Soon after, as he finished bathing, Lán WàngJī came out, wearing not the dressing gown, but, unexpectedly, the elegant attire of his sect, as well as the forehead ribbon.</p>
        <p>Regardless of whatever Lán WàngJī wore, he was as usual looking graceful.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, I’m done.” said Lán WàngJī, “ It’s your turn to take a bath.”</p>
        <p>Without further ado, Wèi WúXiàn enter the room, removed his clothes and got into the wooden bathtub. </p>
        <p>He sank in the bathtub until water covered his mouth, then, he started, like a kid, to produce bubbles.</p>
        <p>“If my guess is correct,” he began to think, “that would mean that Lán Zhàn and I are intimately close.</p>
        <p>“However, if I’m wrong, that would be really embarrassing. I would not have the face to look at Lán Zhàn. And, also, Lán Zhàn might feel unease being with me.”</p>
        <p>He carried on, “I should think it over, once more, shouldn’t I? No. I should calm myself down, I need to calm down, I have to pull myself together.”</p>
        <p>However, by the time he finished bathing, his mind was still in turmoil.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn immediately noticed that he wasn’t as neatly dressed as Lán WàngJī. He had just put on the clean clothes that Lán WàngJī had prepared for him, then, he had thrown on the dark green robe that he was wearing earlier.</p>
        <p>“Oh!” he then released that the green robe was actually the one Lán WàngJī was wearing, and he became extremely embarrassed, he thought “This is an inexcusable act!”</p>
        <p>Then, he saw that Lán WàngJī was coming towards him, and each of his steps made his heart beat more rapidly.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī, however, didn’t stop but went past Wèi WúXiàn. The latter then let out a sigh of relief, however, he also somehow felt disappointed.</p>
        <p>As he turned around in Lán WàngJī’s direction, the first thing Wèi WúXiàn saw was a large white bath towel that landed on his head.</p>
        <p>“Your hair is still wet.” said Lán WàngJī, then, he began to wipe Wèi WúXiàn ’s hair. Starting from the scalp, he softly massaged Wèi WúXiàn ’s head, then carried on bit by bit rubbing the whole hair.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn felt as though he was float on a cloud, feeling relaxed and peaceful, and everything around him became silent, excepted the rustle of his hair being wiped.</p>
        <p>As he finished wiping Wèi WúXiàn’s hair, Lán WàngJī went to put the bath towel on the dressing screen, then, he walked back. Using his spiritual power, Lán WàngJī began to run his fingers through Wèi WúXiàn’s long hair so to dry them up.</p>
        <p>“Why did he use the bath towel if he could dry my hair with his spiritual power?” Wèi WúXiàn was still pondering on the matter when Lán WàngJī’s voice interrupted his thoughts.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, where do you want to sleep?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“This indeed is a good question.” thought Wèi WúXiàn, then, he raised his head to look at Lán WàngJī, and read a lustful look on his handsome face, a look that set fire on his whole body.</p>
        <p>In a languid voice, Wèi WúXiàn managed to ask, “Lán Zhàn, where do you usually sleep?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī didn’t say anything, he just pointed his finger towards a door leading to another room.</p>
        <p>“All right, then. Goodnight.” said Wèi WúXiàn, and quickly went to the bed in which he woke up this morning, while repeating to himself ‘Calm yourself down’, like chanting an incantation.</p>
        <p>Lying alone on the bed, and without removing his forehead ribbon, Lán WàngJī occupied his mind with the rules of his sect in order to cool himself down.</p>
        <p>He didn’t want to rush Wèi WúXiàn, he was prepared to wait until his Wèi Yīng got ready to accept him. And, this time, Lán WàngJī wanted him to experience things far better than before.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then turned over to one side, then, the very next instance, he turned over to the other side, then, finally, he turned to face the ceiling, unable to find some sleep.</p>
        <p>Through the window, the moonlight shone brightly into the room, like the night his Wèi Yīng had returned, reminiscing Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>He then began to meditate so to soothe the pain felt from his swollen manhood.</p>
        <p>Some time had elapsed before Lán WàngJī began to hear some faint noises.</p>
        <p>In the main room, also unable to sleep, Wèi WúXiàn was pacing back and forth, he inwardly said, “I want to see Lán Zhàn’s sleeping face, I’ll just take a furtive quick look.”</p>
        <p>Having made up his mind, Wèi WúXiàn quietly enter the room, and, to his surprise, Lán WàngJī was not sleeping, but rather fixing his eyes on him intensively.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn nervously said, “Lán Zhàn, I’m thirsty.”</p>
        <p>“Thirsty?” Lán WàngJī’s voice was low and hoarse, “The pot of water is on the table.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then turned around, and, from where he was standing he could see the table of the main room, yes, indeed, there was a clay pot on the table.</p>
        <p>From his own bed, Wèi WúXiàn was only few metres away from the table. It was then obvious that he did not get up to drink water.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī walked to the table, poured water on a cup, warmed up the cup with his spiritual power, then, he turned to look at Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>His intense and fiery gaze made Wèi WúXiàn’s legs wobble. For a while, both of them looked at each other.</p>
        <p>Then, still holding the cup of warm water, Lán WàngJī walked up to him, then put directly the cup to Wèi WúXiàn’s lips as to help him drink.</p>
        <p>Out of force of habit, Wèi WúXiàn held the hand that carried the cup to his lips, then, he took two gulps of water.</p>
        <p>All of a sudden, he paused, and the time seemed to have stopped.</p>
        <p>“Something is not quite right!” Wèi WúXiàn was puzzled, “How could I just drink up from Lán Zhàn’s hand? What is even more wrong is the fact that Lán Zhàn himself initiates me to do so.”</p>
        <p>With the rim of the cup still pressed on his lips, Wèi WúXiàn looked up at Lán WàngJī, and was at once sucked into his burning gaze.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, the air around him became dense, and, within himself, something was furtively warming up.</p>
    </div>

        <br />
        <p>Lán WàngJī seemed to gulp involuntarily. “Are you done drinking?” he asked.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then let go of Lán WàngJī’s hand, as well as removing his lips away from the cup, then, he nodded.</p>
        <p>On his lower lip, some tiny droplets of water were softly sparkling, which made the delicate red lips become more sensual.</p>
        <p>At the sight of these inviting lips, Lán WàngJī unconsciously clenched his free hand into a fist, he said, “All right.” then walked to the table to put back the cup.</p>
        <p>For a short while, none of them spoke, then, suddenly, Lán WàngJī, who was still standing by the table, walked back to Wèi WúXiàn and hugged him.</p>
        <p>As one would expect, Wèi WúXiàn did not push him away, or struggle to set free, he just let Lán WàngJī embrace him.</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī carried Wèi WúXiàn in his arms, went to the bed, and laid him down.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then sat up and looked at Lán WàngJī, who was standing by the bed, tall and silent. Light from the candle cast a shadow on his face, so Wèi WúXiàn was unable see his expression.</p>
        <p>His breathing quickened, then, after a short while, Wèi WúXiàn shifted so to make room in the bed, quietly inviting Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī slowly sat down on the bed, then, in a hoarse voice, he asked, “You can’t sleep?”</p>
        <p>“I can’t find sleep.” he replied, “Lull me to sleep.”</p>
        <p>With his slender fingers, Lán WàngJī stroked Wèi WúXiàn’s fringe, then gently tucked it behind the ear. He looked into his eyes, and began to humming a gentle and serene tune, the same tune that Wèi WúXiàn played in the morning.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn began to stare at Lán WàngJī vacantly, while his mind was gradually wandering away. Then, after a while, he dreamily uttered, ‘WàngXiàn’.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī abruptly stopped humming, his eyes widened in surprise.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, isn’t ‘WàngXiàn’ the name of the tune that you just hummed? ” he asked.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī’s breathing became so heavy that one could clearly see the up and down movements of his chest, he replied, “Yes.”</p>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn began to ask a series of questions.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, didn’t you give me the white guqin as a gift?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“Yes, I did.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“Didn’t I give you the white bracelet that you wore today?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Yes, you did.” Lán WàngJī replied.</p>
        <p>“Do we always travel together and wear identical clothes, and read the same novels in which you know which passages are my favourite?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“Yes, that’s correct.” he replied.</p>
        <p>This time, however, before asking his question, Wèi WúXiàn nervously clenched his fists, then, he took a deep breath, “Lán Zhàn, what kind of relationship do we have?”</p>
        <p>“What do you think?” Lán WàngJī replied, then, he sighed, “Wèi Yīng, what kind of relationship do you wish us to have?”</p>
        <p>As he spoke, the warm yellow light of the candle showered on his eyelashes. Lán WàngJī intensively fixed his lustful eyes on Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>With this beautiful face, having this sensual expression with this burning gaze, in addition, in this suggestive atmosphere, Wèi WúXiàn seemed to have lost reason, his whole body began to ignite.</p>
        <p>Then, impulsively, he moved forward and kissed Lán WàngJī so passionately that he hit his lower lip against Lán WàngJī’s teeth.</p>
        <p>The slight pain felt from his lip brought back his sense, he hastily retreated, and quickly began to say, “This is not...”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī pulled him in his arms, then, feverishly, he began to kiss him. Lán WàngJī’s tongue went deep into his mouth, sweeping every area of it, then, he entwined his own tongue with his, bringing out Wèi WúXiàn’s tongue, and sucking it with all passion he had.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn let out an ‘aah’ sound, which caused Lán WàngJī to pause. Then, he resumed shortly after, however, this time, his kisses became more gentle.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī untied Wèi WúXiàn’s hair ribbon, then, slowly, he ran his fingers through his long hair, and then, he gently slid his fingers behind Wèi WúXiàn’s neck, then carried on caressing his back, progressively moving down and stroking Wèi WúXiàn’s slender waist.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, his tongue still explored Wèi WúXiàn’s mouth, softly intertwined their both tongues.</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī began to tease Wèi WúXiàn, he slowly ran the tip of his tongue on Wèi WúXiàn’s soft and sensitive lips, tracing the edges of the lips.</p>
        <p>Then, at his leisure, he gave Wèi WúXiàn a series of soft kisses on the forehead, on the eyelids, on the cheeks, on the top and lower lips, as well as on the corners of the lips, then, he gently began to suck Wèi WúXiàn’s lips.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn began to feel woozy from Lán WàngJī’s kisses, his whole body became hot.</p>
        <p>After a while, Lán WàngJī released him, then, in a deep voice, he asked, “Wèi Yīng, did you dislike it?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn looked at him with a dazed expression on his face, he absent-mindedly asked “What?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī kissed him again, then, he asked, “You don’t like it, when I kiss you?”</p>
        <p>“How could I possible dislike it?” replied Wèi WúXiàn, “It should be me, who should ask this question?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī smiled, then kissed him softly, and then, he confessed, “Wèi Yīng, in Baifeng Mountain*, it’s was me, who kissed you.”</p>
        <small>*Baifeng Mountain is the place where Lán WàngJī steals Wèi WúXiàn’s first kiss, furtively.</small>
        <p>“What?” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, extremely surprised, this revelation sobered him up.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī, however, did not let him remain sober, as he began to kiss him again, and, this time, his kisses were vigorous, impatient and fiery.</p>
        <p>He hugged Wèi WúXiàn tight, his lips devoured his, then, he slid his tongue into his mouth, and entangled it with Wèi WúXiàn’s tongue.</p>
        <p>After playing with his tongue, Lán WàngJī returned to Wèi WúXiàn’s lips, and began to kiss and suck them until they became numb, and until Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body began to beg for more.</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī slid his hands through Wèi WúXiàn’s sleeves, the palms of his hands were comfortably warm that they made Wèi WúXiàn become more inviting.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, compared to when Lán WàngJī caressed him through his nightclothes, the feeling of his hands directly stroking every inch of his bare back made Wèi WúXiàn feel more and more horny, he was trembling with pleasure.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī moved one hand down to Wèi WúXiàn’s hips, and slid it through the underwear, and then, gently, he began to stroke his hips, while his other hand carried on caressing Wèi WúXiàn’s back.</p>
        <p>As he realised that he became hard, Wèi WúXiàn felt ashamed, and, in order to avoid Lán WàngJī to notice it, he put his hands against Lán WàngJī’s chest, and moved back.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī didn’t want to force him, he just let go of him, and then, they looked at each other, both were out of breath from their kisses and burning desire for each other.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī looked like someone who had reached his limit, the desire shown through his eyes was way too strong, that there was no word to describe it, and Wèi WúXiàn had not seen to that extent Lán WàngJī’s eyes looked.</p>
        <p>Controlling his desire, Lán WàngJī put his hand on Wèi WúXiàn’s shoulder, and the latter could not help but tremble a little bit.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī paused, and then, he began to adjust Wèi WúXiàn’s nightclothes, and, accidentally, his fingers brushed his neck, and Wèi WúXiàn moaned, which stirred Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>With great effort, Lán WàngJī got a hold of himself, and, slowly, he began to withdraw his hand, however, Wèi WúXiàn caught Lán WàngJī’s hand, and the latter looked at him with a questioning expression on his face.</p>
        <p>And then, he said out loud his most desire, “Wèi Yīng, I want you.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn slowly nodded in agreement, and Lán WàngJī, without losing any moment, began to untie the top of Wèi WúXiàn’s his nightclothes.</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī undressed him, it seemed to Wèi WúXiàn that everything were running in a slow motion, namely, the time taken for his top to slide off of his shoulders, the time Lán WàngJī took to hold his arms and peel off the sleeves, as well as removing completely his nightclothes.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng?”, Lán WàngJī’s eyes seemed to ask Wèi WúXiàn if he was ready to receive him, which made Wèi WúXiàn extremely embarrassed that he felt like covering his naked body.</p>
        <p>“I... I am a little bit skinny now.” Then, he remembered that this current body was not his origin one.</p>
        <p>Earlier, when he was taking a bath, he was so preoccupied by the nature of their relationship that it didn’t cross his mind to have a look at his new body.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī thought that he was comparing his current body to his former one, he said, “Wèi Yīng, you look handsome, and your body is really attractive.”</p>
        <p>Then, he began to caress Wèi WúXiàn’s neck, then his shoulders, and then his chest, pinching and twisting slightly his nipples.</p>
        <p>“Aah” Wèi WúXiàn gave a moan of pleasure.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, in order to keep you satisfied, I learned how to cook.”whispered Lán WàngJī to his ear, “I’ll cook whatever you want me to cook for you.”</p>
        <p>“Uh-huh.” agreed Wèi WúXiàn, and, somehow, he seemed not surprised to learn that Lán WàngJī could cook.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then carried on stroking his whole upper body, slowly and gently.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was feeling very embarrassed as well as overwhelmed by the way Lán WàngJī touched me, while looking at him with his burning desire written on his eyes.</p>
        <p>He could not help but said, “Lán Zhàn, can you stop looking at me? It’s really embarrassing.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī chuckled, then, gently, he pushed him down on the bed, and lay on the top of Wèi WúXiàn, and then, he began to kiss his lips, slowly moving down and gently biting his neck and shoulder, then, he moved further down, licking and biting Wèi WúXiàn’s nipples.</p>
        <p>For several days, he did not touch Wèi WúXiàn, and, moreover, for two days, Wèi WúXiàn’s body was soaked wet, as a result, his bite marks on Wèi WúXiàn’s skin had all vanished, Lán WàngJī noted.</p>
        <p>After leaving his marks on Wèi WúXiàn, Lán WàngJī, in turn, began to suck both nipples.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn never knew that being touched by the nipples could feel so strong. He could not help but struggle to set himself free.</p>
        <p>This time, however, Lán WàngJī didn’t let him escape. He took Wèi WúXiàn’s wrists, put them above Wèi WúXiàn’s head, and, with one hand, he held both wrists steady on the bed, and then, he carried on sucking his nipples.</p>

        <br />
        <p>For the most part of the day, Wèi WúXiàn was anxious about misinterpreting Lán WàngJī’s kindness towards him. However, it turned out that, what he had taken earlier as his own fantasy became true.</p>
        <p>And, right now, he was pinned down on the bed, and was kissed and fondled by Lán WàngJī. All this happened at too fast pace for Wèi WúXiàn to cope with.</p>
        <p>As a teenager, Wèi WúXiàn had read a lot of illustrated pornographic books, however, he never came across those that involved two men relationship.</p>
        <p>On top of that, Lán WàngJī’s techniques in bed were exceedingly good, turning what he had learned from books to dust, and leaving him without any other options but to lie down and be at the mercy of Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>However, he was still ashamed to let Lán WàngJī notice his swollen and aching manhood. Yet, with Lán WàngJī’s hands that had already reached his hips, it was only a matter of time before he found out.</p>
        <p>Under the skilful touch of Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn bit his lip so to stop himself from moaning, however, he could not prevent his toes from curling in pleasure, nor his feet from moving uncontrollable.</p>
        <p>Before losing his memories, Wèi WúXiàn would not be subdued so easily, like he was now, lying down submissively and let Lán WàngJī do as his please.</p>
        <p>Now that, in his mind, Wèi WúXiàn was a teenager, Lán WàngJī found him so cute as he tried his best to conceal his reaction; something that he wouldn’t normally do.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then slid his hand inside Wèi WúXiàn’s underwear and held his swollen manhood. As he did, Wèi WúXiàn let out a muttered moan.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, don’t bite your lips.” said Lán WàngJī, then, he put his fingers on Wèi WúXiàn’s lips, and parted them, while his other hand stroked his private parts.</p>
        <p>Then, from Wèi WúXiàn’s lips until his belly button, Lán WàngJī slowly covered this path with light kisses, and, when he reached the belly button, using the tip of his tongue, he licked his navel and around it.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then reached the state of ecstasy, he could no longer bear this excessive pleasure, and called out his name, “Lán Zhàn.”</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, everything is all right.” said Lán WàngJī, then, he began to take off Wèi WúXiàn’s underwear.</p>
        <p>Unconsciously, Wèi WúXiàn raised his hips so to assist Lán WàngJī on his task, then, he felt ashamed from his own action, but it was too later, because his swollen manhood was already in display for Lán WàngJī to admire.</p>
        <p>However, Wèi WúXiàn could not help but closed his legs tight.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī thrust his knee between Wèi WúXiàn’s legs, and opened them up, then, he wrapped his hand around his manhood, and began to rubbed it up an down, introducing some variations by stroking the head with the palm his hand in a circular motion, and also by teasing the small open with his finger.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī knew all Wèi WúXiàn’s erogenous zones, and the latter felt so good that he thought he would die if it carried on like this, wondering why Lán WàngJī so good at it.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, it occurred to him that he should not be the only one to feel good. Wèi WúXiàn sat up so to remove Lán WàngJī’s nightclothes.</p>
        <p>However, Lán WàngJī gently pushed him back on the bed, and said, “Wèi Yīng, don’t move, just leave everything to me.”</p>
        <p>So, Wèi WúXiàn did as he was told, letting Lán WàngJī lead the way.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then lowered his head, and took him deeply into his mouth, and, “Aaah!” Wèi WúXiàn could not suppress a clear and loud moan.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, you don’t need to do that.” Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body was trembling uncontrollable under such surge of sexual pleasure.</p>
        <p>Since Lán WàngJī was expecting Wèi WúXiàn to resist him, he pressed down on Wèi WúXiàn’s hips and legs so to prevent him from wriggling, while he performed fellatio on him.</p>
        <p>Whenever Lán WàngJī wanted to take him into his mouth, Wèi WúXiàn always refused him to do so. At that moment of their love squabble, Lán WàngJī loved watching him trying to resist but fail, trying to escape but never exceed, and the way Wèi WúXiàn would finally surrender to him.</p>
        <p>In the end, Wèi WúXiàn was not able to free himself, because Lán WàngJī’s strength was too great for him to overcome, and was feeling as though Lán WàngJī was sucked each area of his body.</p>
        <p>Inside of Lán WàngJī’s mouth was wet and warm, which added more pleasant feeling, as Lán WàngJī kept on sucking his manhood, as well as licking the head, and teasing the small open with the tip of his tongue.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn could not believe that the person who was at this instance fellating him was none other than Lán WàngJī. So, he closed his eyes tight since he didn’t dare to look at him.</p>
        <p>The pleasure from his lower body was getting higher and higher, the sucking techniques of Lán WàngJī were so good that it became harder for Wèi WúXiàn to restrain himself from crying out loud, as well as from stopping the blood that kept on rushing into his private parts.</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī deeply swallowed him, his throat contracted around the head of Wèi WúXiàn’s manhood. It felt so good that Wèi WúXiàn bit his fingers, which prevented him from moaning.</p>
        <p>“If it carries on like this,” Wèi WúXiàn said inwardly, “I will soon come inside Lán Zhàn’s mouth. I can’t do that to Lán Zhàn. I must not!”</p>
        <p>In his despair, Wèi WúXiàn seemed to have found the salvation that would lessen his raging desire and calm the surge of blood that rushed into his manhood.</p>
        <p>He began to recite the rules of GūsūLán:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <em>Do not rest until the end of the day.</em><br />
            <em>Do not keep sleeping once it’s dawn.</em><br />
            <em>Do not be picky eater.</em><br />
            <em>Do not drink alcohol.</em><br />
            <em>Do not stand or sit incorrectly.</em><br />
            <em>Do not eat more than three bowls of rice a day...</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn remembered the rules that he had copied as a punishment, and, unintentionally, he ended up reciting them aloud.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then raised his head, and said, “Wèi Yīng, you don’t need recite our sect’s rules.”</p>
        <p>However, Wèi WúXiàn refused to listen to Lán WàngJī. The latter understood that Wèi WúXiàn was about to come, but he didn’t want to release in his mouth, so Lán WàngJī used his hand to make him come.</p>
        <p>As he at last ejaculated, Wèi WúXiàn gasped for breath, and his whole body quivered, and then, once it’s done, he sat up.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, I’ll help you, too.” he said.</p>
        <p>However, Lán WàngJī, once more, pushed him back on the bed, then, with his fingers, he collected Wèi WúXiàn’s white fluid, and, gently, he began to rub the open Wèi WúXiàn’s anus, and then, slowly, he inserted a finger into it, and carried on rubbing the inside of the tiny hole.</p>
        <p>Like on their first time, even though he had guessed it, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Lán Zhàn, what did you put in?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī paused and asked, “Can I put mine into here?”</p>
        <p>“What?” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, since he had thought that between men it was only about kissing, hugging and eventually helping each other release by using either a hand or mouth, just like what Lán WàngJī did to him.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī resumed rubbing inside him, causing Wèi WúXiàn to feel a tickling sensation, then, he said, “If you want to help me, let me put mine inside you.”</p>
        <p>“You don’t need to ask, just do it.’ replied Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>So, he let Lán WàngJī broaden his horizons, letting himself to experience something completely new to him.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī carried on rubbing inside Wèi WúXiàn, and, for time to time, he moved his finger in a circular motion, and then, in a low voice, he asked, “Are you all right?”</p>
        <p>In addition of being pinned down, having Lán WàngJī’s finger inside him, and having to see his expression that seemed to say ‘I understand that you know nothing about this, so I will teach you’, Lán WàngJī’s question just added to his embarrassment.</p>
        <p>“I’ve already said to you that you don’t need to ask me. It’s really embarrassing.” Wèi WúXiàn replied.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī seemed to chuckled, then, inserting another finger, he found the P-spot and pressed on it.</p>
        <p>“Aaah! Lán Zhàn!” Wèi WúXiàn moaned loudly, and he almost jumped off the bed, then, inwardly, he wondered, “Why is there something like that inside a man’s body?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī began gently to rub the spot, which caused Wèi WúXiàn to twist his hips in order to escape.</p>
        <p>“You said yourself that I don’t need to ask you.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was defeated by his own words. So, he then stopped struggling and spread up his legs, surrendering himself to Lán WàngJī, and letting him do as he pleased.</p>
        <p>His submission was a delightful pleasure to Lán WàngJī. He became even more determined to make Wèi WúXiàn experience a far greater climax. He began to move his fingers up and down inside him, and then, he put the third finger.</p>
        <p>“Aaah!” Wèi WúXiàn let out a moan. With two fingers, it was already too much for him to bear, now that Lán WàngJī inserted the third one, he could not help but, involuntarily, tightened his buttocks, and curled his toes.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, try to relax.” said Lán WàngJī, then, in order to let Wèi WúXiàn get used to it, he was now moving his fingers less deeper inside him.</p>
        <p>Anxious, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Lán Zhàn, is this really the way it is done? Are you not mistaken?”</p>
        <p>With a smile on his face, Lán WàngJī replied, “Uh-huh, I will show you.” Then, he pressed on the sensitive P-spot, which caused Wèi WúXiàn to reach another climax.</p>
        <p>And then, Wèi WúXiàn spread his legs once more, and said, “Come inside, then.”</p>
        <p>“There is no need to hurry things up.” replied Lán WàngJī. Then, picking up a slow and regular rhythm, he carried on moving his fingers inside Wèi WúXiàn, rubbing his spot, massaging every area inside him so to make the tiny hole loose a little bit.</p>
        <p>Gradually, Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body relaxed, and it seemed to him that the inside of his hole was getting slippery.</p>
        <p>Then, once more, Lán WàngJī covered Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body with light kisses, and the latter kept on moaning under each of his touch.</p>
        <p>Embarrassed by all these moans, Wèi WúXiàn tried his best to restraint himself.</p>
    </div>

        <br />
        <p>Lán WàngJī then sucked Wèi WúXiàn’s earlobe, and then, he whispered to his ear, “Wèi Yīng, I want to hear your moans.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn wondered, “Did I hear it wrong? Is it really Lán Zhàn? Such lecherous words coming from his mouth is an extreme sexual arousal.”</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī showed no longer mercy, his fingers went deeper inside Wèi WúXiàn, and, continuously, he rubbed his P-spot, which had, as a result, made Wèi WúXiàn cry out loud.</p>
        <p>Gradually, Lán WàngJī sped up the movements of his fingers inside Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī kept on stimulating his P-spot, Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body was filled with an intense feeling of pleasure, and his mind seemed to float in the air. Then, finally, he released once again.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then stopped moving his fingers, and, slowly, withdrew them, and then, he kissed Wèi WúXiàn on the forehead, which was now covered with tiny little droplets of sweat.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn gazed vacantly in font of him, the open of his hole kept on throbbing, and, for a short while, his mind went blank.</p>
        <p>“Good grief! Just by using his fingers, Lán Zhàn made me come.” inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn said, “I have to return the favour.”</p>
        <p>Then, he sat up, once more, in order to take off Lán WàngJī’s nightclothes, however, he was pushed back on the bed, once again.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī took off his forehead ribbon, loosely tied Wèi WúXiàn’s wrists above the head, then, he secured the ribbon on the bedhead.</p>
        <p>Since the ribbon was not firmly tied around his writs, Wèi WúXiàn could easily free himself, however, he opted not to do it.</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī took off his nightclothes, including his underwear, opened a small black box laid by one corner of the bed, took out a container of ointment, then, he applied ointment on his manhood, despite Wèi WúXiàn being already wet.</p>
        <p>As he lubricated his private parts, Wèi WúXiàn looked at Lán WàngJī’s manhood, and was shocked, “Sheesh! Why are you so big?”</p>
        <p>Then, he wondered, “Will this huge stuff fit in me?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then held Wèi WúXiàn by the hips, and the latter, unconsciously, moved backwards.</p>
        <p>In a gentle tone, Lán WàngJī reassured him, “Wèi Yīng, don’t be afraid. I won’t be ruthless.”</p>
        <p>“Here we go again with his ‘Don’t worry, I’ll teach you’ attitude.” Wèi WúXiàn was little bit annoyed, and quickly replied, “Who is afraid? If you want to put it in, just go ahead. I have plenty of experience.”</p>
        <p>Then, both of them were stunned by the last sentence, since Wèi WúXiàn had said the same thing before.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng!” Lán WàngJī looked at him with an eye that conveyed all his love he had for him, because his words brought him back to their conversation in Baifeng Mountain, just short after he had stolen his first kiss.</p>
        <p>As he had lost his memories, and he didn’t remember that he had already told Lán WàngJī that what he had said, back then, in Baifeng Mountain was a lie, Wèi WúXiàn interpreted Lán WàngJī’s loving expression as ‘Even though you have done it with others, I still love you.’</p>
        <p>So, since he didn’t want Lán WàngJī to have a wrong opinion of him, he hurriedly said, “It’s not true. I don’t have any experience. Trust me. This is my first time doing it with you.”</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī understood that Wèi WúXiàn bragged about his “experience” because he didn’t want to look like a novice.</p>
        <p>As he noticed some change on Lán WàngJī’s expression, Wèi WúXiàn thought that he didn’t believe him.</p>
        <p>So, wrapping his legs around Lán WàngJī’s waist, Wèi WúXiàn said, “I’ve never even held any girl’s hands. Lán Zhàn, you are the only one for me, and, in the future, there will be only you.”</p>
        <p>Then, he felt relieved to have said the truth.</p>
        <p>However, by mentioning girls, Wèi WúXiàn had unknowingly touched a topic that was like a thorn piercing Lán WàngJī’s heart, since the latter was extremely jealous each time Wèi WúXiàn was flirting with girls.</p>
        <p>Reminding himself that, right now, the most important thing was to make Wèi WúXiàn feel good, Lán WàngJī took a deep breath, and suppressed all those old jealousies he had felt.</p>
        <p>He then held the back of Wèi WúXiàn’s knees, and pushed the knees forward until they got close to Wèi WúXiàn’s chest.</p>
        <p>Under this posture, Lán WàngJī had a full view of Wèi WúXiàn’s private parts. </p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn did not recall to have seen such a posture on the erotic books he had read.</p>
        <p>“This is really indecent.” thought Wèi WúXiàn, “Is Lán Zhàn going to put his stuff in this lewd posture? Is this his first time?”</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, look at me. I’m going to put mine inside you.” said Lán WàngJī, then, he held his huge manhood, and inserted only the head, letting Wèi WúXiàn to get used to it.</p>
        <p>After a short while, he added, “Wèi Yīng, watch carefully.” Then, slowly, he inserted the whole stuff.</p>
        <p>“Aaah!” Wèi WúXiàn could not help but moan. He didn’t know what was more stimulant; was it because Lán WàngJī’s deep voice telling him to look, or was it the view of his manhood entering him, or was it the sensation he felt for having Lán WàngJī inside him?</p>
        <p>With Lán WàngJī’s manhood fully inserted inside him, Wèi WúXiàn felt that the inside of his hole was reshaped to fit Lán WàngJī’s size.</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī began to move, slowly making the back and forward motions, so to let Wèi WúXiàn adapt to his size.</p>
        <p>His soft movements, however, were enough to make Wèi WúXiàn let out some soft cries.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī was very gentle, however, at the same time, he seemed to let Wèi WúXiàn know that he was a little bit jealous. And, somehow, Wèi WúXiàn felt good that Lán WàngJī was jealous because of him.</p>
        <p>With the exception of swollen sensation felt when Lán WàngJī entered him, Wèi WúXiàn experienced a great feeling for his “first” time because Lán WàngJī’s plenty of foreplay.</p>
        <p>While making a great effort for not losing control, Lán WàngJī carried on moving slowly and gently inside Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>So, gradually, the swollen sensation that Wèi WúXiàn had felt changed into sexual pleasure. And, all this happened while he was watching.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then felt too embarrassed to keep on watching Lán WàngJī moving inside him, and turned his gaze away.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, don’t look away.” said Lán WàngJī, then, he held Wèi WúXiàn’s chin and made him turn his head towards him.</p>
        <p>Watching Lán WàngJī moving his manhood back and forth inside him, again and again, was indeed very erotic.</p>
        <p>However, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t want to be the only one feeling embarrassed, he asked, “Does it feel good, being inside me?”</p>
        <p>Unknown to him, because of his amnesia, this was not the first time he asked Lán WàngJī this question. In other words, the latter had already got used to it.</p>
        <p>So, by observing Wèi WúXiàn’s expression, Lán WàngJī saw through him, he replied, “It does feel good.” then, he asked, “Do you want me to move fast?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn felt that his face was suddenly burned with embarrassment by Lán WàngJī’s question.</p>
        <p>Noting that Wèi WúXiàn got used to his huge stuff, Lán WàngJī began to move faster and vigorously, bumping every small area inside Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Soon after, the sound of the back and forth motion became audible, and some white foam began to form, and circled around Lán WàngJī’s manhood.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn didn’t dare to watch any longer, so, he closed his eyes. However, the fact of closing his eyes made him feel Lán WàngJī even more intensively. The sexual pleasure slid along his spine, and carried on throughout his whole body, including his fingertips and toes.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, don’t close your eyes. Keep watching.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then obeyed, and opened his eyes just as Lán WàngJī moved his huge stuff back, displaying a full view of his manhood covered with white fluid.</p>
        <p>The watery sound coming from his hole seemed to have increased, as Lán WàngJī now moved his stuff forth, deeply penetrating inside him, and making Wèi WúXiàn feel extremely good, that he reached the high point.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn thought that it was too much. With his wrists still loosely tied above his head, he scratched on the framework of the bedhead with his fingers.</p>
        <p>The stimulating view of being penetrated over and over, and the pleasure that these back and forth movements provided kept on piling up within him.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn.” he called in low voice. Wèi WúXiàn was overwhelmed under such extreme pleasure.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī seemed to have smiled, he leaned forward and gave Wèi WúXiàn a light kiss on the lips. Then, as though he was stimulated by Wèi WúXiàn calling his name, Lán WàngJī began to move much faster and intensively.</p>
        <p>“Ah... ah... ahh... agh... Lán Zhàn, I’m still a virgin.” said Wèi WúXiàn between moans and gasps.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī simply replied, “I know.” However, he didn’t slow down, but kept on bumping faster and harder.</p>
        <p>Although Wèi WúXiàn’s posture was not quite comfortable, Lán WàngJī’s repetitive and vigorous back and forth motions were really making him feel extremely good under this posture.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn kept on moaning louder and louder, feeling an intense sensation from his hole, and his swollen manhood began to ache.</p>
        <p>Since he had intensified his movements, Lán WàngJī was afraid that Wèi WúXiàn would not be able to keep up, so, he decided to change Wèi WúXiàn’s posture.</p>
        <p>He rested Wèi WúXiàn’s legs on his shoulders, grabbed few pillows and put them under Wèi WúXiàn’s loins.</p>
        <p>Following Lán WàngJī’s action, Wèi WúXiàn seemed to understand why, earlier, he had noticed that there were so many pillows on the bed.</p>
        <p>However, he could not ponder on the matter much longer, because Lán WàngJī now rose his buttocks, and placed them in the way that he could hit directly Wèi WúXiàn’s weak spot, then, he resumed bumping inside him.</p>
        <p>“Aaah... Lán Zhàn... agh... it feels so good... I can’t take it any more... I’m coming again.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then held Wèi WúXiàn’s swollen manhood, and began to rub it up and down, while he kept on pounding inside him.</p>
        <p>And, soon after, like a volcano in eruption, a series of white fluids was ejected from it, while Wèi WúXiàn was crying and trembling uncontrollably, and, at the same time, Lán WàngJī was also releasing inside him.</p>
        <p>After a short while, Wèi WúXiàn said while panting, “Agh... Lán Zhàn, you’re really awesome.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then leaned over him, and began to stroke his upper body gently and softly, then, he moved his hand down, fondling Wèi WúXiàn’s hips.</p>
        <p>Under Lán WàngJī’s caress, Wèi WúXiàn felt so fulfilled that he freed his wrists from the ribbon, wrapped his arms around Lán WàngJī’s neck, and began to kiss him tenderly.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī held him tight and kissed him back.</p>
        <p>The overwhelming pleasure that Wèi WúXiàn felt slowly quietened down. They were now surrounded by a tranquil atmosphere.</p>
        <p>However, in this serene mood, Lán WàngJī’s huge stuff was still erect.</p>
        <p>Soon, he began to move again inside Wèi WúXiàn, and the latter, surprised, called out, “Lán Zhàn!”</p>
        <p>As a reply to the call, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, that will take a while. ”</p>

        <br />
        <p>“HánGuāng-Jūn, am I not injured?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“By no means.” Lán WàngJī replied.</p>
        <p>“Really? You did it so hard.”</p>
        <p>“Then, let me have a look.” Lán WàngJī stopped moving and pulled out his manhood.</p>
        <p>“What?!” cried Wèi WúXiàn, then, he set himself free from Lán WàngJī’s arms, put some distance between them, and then, he added, “What do you mean by having a look? I was joking.”</p>
        <p>Without saying anything, Lán WàngJī reached out for the black box, and took out the same ointment as before.</p>
        <p>Although he perfectly knew that he didn’t injure Wèi WúXiàn, especially that this night was his “first time”, still, he wanted to apply the salve on Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Back then, on their first day, Lán WàngJī felt a little bit bitter afterwards, because he had injured Wèi WúXiàn due to his lack of experience; he didn’t know that he should have applied an ointment.</p>
        <p>Therefore, this time, he didn’t want to make the same mistake.</p>
        <p>Seeing what Lán WàngJī was holding on his hand, Wèi WúXiàn began to wonder, “Is it not the ointment? Why does he need it for?” then, he realised, “Don’t tell me that he’s going to apply it there! No way! It’s so embarrassing.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s first react was to run away, however, he was rooted to the spot by Lán WàngJī’s glance.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, you’re not allow to leave the bed.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Then, he held Wèi WúXiàn’s ankles, and gently pulled him back. And then, he put Wèi WúXiàn’s legs on his shoulders, once more, and rose his buttocks.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn thought, “Earlier, he induced me to watch, and now, he coaxes me to let him have a look.”</p>
        <p>However, this time, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t want to be subdued so easily.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, I’m really fine. I don’t need that.” Wèi WúXiàn implored.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī paid no heed to his demand. After raising Wèi WúXiàn buttocks, he now used his fingers to probe the open of the hole, then, he put two fingers inside, and slightly spread the hole.</p>
        <p>Everything was all right, and, with this posture, while applying the ointment, it would not leak out, thought Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Then, after taking some portion of the salve, he began gently to apply it on Wèi WúXiàn’s hole.</p>
        <p>“Agh...” Wèi WúXiàn moaned. He could not help it, especially after being bumped so vigorously.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī massaged the hole by making circular motions with his fingers, softly rubbing the inside, which still had his white fluid, and, moreover, it produced a clear sound as his fingers moved about the hole.</p>
        <p>Becoming embarrassed by the erotic sound, Wèi WúXiàn began slightly to twist his hips so to avoid Lán WàngJī’s touch.</p>
        <p>The more Lán WàngJī excelled in his way of making him feel good, the more embarrassing it became for Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Are you okay?” asked Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Um, it feels a little bit cold.” he replied, then, “Lán Zhàn, can I do it on my own?”</p>
        <p>“No, you can’t.”</p>
        <p>Although he didn’t plan on applying the ointment on Wèi WúXiàn, however, since it had crossed his mind, he might as well do it himself, and do it properly for Wèi WúXiàn’s sake.</p>
        <p>Back then, everything happened very fast, like a dry woods catching fire, and, in a instant, everything turned into a blazing fire.</p>
        <p>He was not mentally prepared for it, and was caught by the fire of his own long-holding-back desire, and unleashed his passions that he could scarcely control.</p>
        <p>He had frenetically moved inside Wèi WúXiàn, over and over, since, at that time, he had felt that it was not enough for him to stop, that his desire had not been quenched yet.</p>
        <p>If only, back then, he had taken good care of him, he would not be injured.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī withdrew his fingers to take some more ointment, then, he applied it directly on Wèi WúXiàn’s sensitive area.</p>
        <p>From now on, there would be other occasions to mend his past mistake. So, for now, Lán WàngJī didn’t want to be distracted by what happened back then, he only wanted to make Wèi WúXiàn feel happy and fully satisfied.</p>
        <p>“Agh...” However, Wèi WúXiàn could not bear his touch, and his breath gradually became heavy, because, not long ago, he had an orgasm, and, as a result, his whole body became very sensitive to withstand an erotic massage. Naturally, his manhood began to react.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, can you let me lie on my stomach?” he asked, so that, in this position, Lán WàngJī would not notice his reaction.</p>
        <p>“No, I can’t.” he replied, and also, he noticed that Wèi WúXiàn was getting hard.</p>
        <p>“At least, don’t raise my bottom so high.” Wèi WúXiàn was really embarrassed.</p>
        <p>“That won’t do.” he stopped moving his fingers inside Wèi WúXiàn, and added, “This position allows me to see inside more clearly.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then began to twist left and right.</p>
        <p>In an earnest tone, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, this is just a mere application of the ointment.”</p>
        <p>Then, he resumed his massage by skilfully drawing circles around Wèi WúXiàn’s weak area, which caused more sexual arousal in Wèi WúXiàn that he began to tremble.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn could not help but grab Lán WàngJī’s hand, and then, he asked, “Lán Zhàn, are you not doing this on purpose?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, I am.”</p>
        <p>“What!?” Wèi WúXiàn didn’t expect Lán WàngJī to admit it so easily.</p>
        <p>“Before, it was not. But now, I’m doing it deliberately.” At the instant he had seen Wèi WúXiàn’s little erection, Lán WàngJī had purposely began to arouse him even more.</p>
        <p>Then, he pressed hard on Wèi WúXiàn’s P-spot.</p>
        <p>“Aaah... Lán Zhàn!” As expected, Wèi WúXiàn spasmed violently, and his manhood got harder.</p>
        <p>“Come on, Lán Zhàn, stop fooling around. If you want to do it, then do it.”</p>
        <p>For a brief instant, a feint smile seemed to have appeared on Lán WàngJī’s face. He pulled out his fingers, and, with the ointment slimily wrapped around his fingers, he applied it around the open of the hole.</p>
        <p>And then, once more, using his forehead ribbon that was still around the bedhead, Lán WàngJī tied Wèi WúXiàn’s wrists. This time, however, he firmly tied them before securing the ribbon on the bedhead.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, the meaning of wearing GūsūLán’s forehead ribbon is to restrain yourself. ” said Lán WàngJī in his deep voice that resounded inside Wèi WúXiàn’s ears.</p>
        <p>He carried on, “Only in the presence of a soulmate, the person you love, that there is no need to restrain yourself.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then leaned over Wèi WúXiàn, and slightly bit his lower lip, then, he said, “Wèi Yīng, I love you.” And then, he looked at him with tenderness. Meanwhile, Wèi WúXiàn’s heart was beating fast.</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī earnestly said, “Wèi Yīng, you and I are a married couple.” His gaze was getting hotter, and Wèi WúXiàn felt as though he was floating in the air.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, he was feeling really embarrassed, and now, it seemed to him that he was surrounded by a beautiful scenery, just like in a fairyland. Wèi WúXiàn was so dumbfounded by what he just learned that he was unable to utter a single word.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī felt a little bit disappointed. It seemed that this time he would not hear Wèi WúXiàn’s passionate confession.</p>
        <p>However, for now, it did not matter, because, the current Wèi WúXiàn didn’t have any painful past, nor having nightmares. Everything was perfect and harmonious, and, as long as Wèi WúXiàn was happy and satisfied, that was all that counted to Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>He then kissed his lips, moved close to his ear and licked his earlobe, and then, he slightly sucked it.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, he whispered to Wèi WúXiàn’s ear, “Wèi Yīng, I want you. Doing it only once is not enough.”</p>
        <p>“Agh!” These whispers were enough to turn him on. And, as a response to Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn wrapped his legs around Lán WàngJī’s waist.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then resumed licking and sucking Wèi WúXiàn’s earlobe, then, he carried down to his neck, and softly bit Wèi WúXiàn’s Adam’s apple.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, he slid his hand between Wèi WúXiàn’s legs, then, he inserted two fingers deeply inside his body. And, from his fingertips, Lán WàngJī released a thin stream of his spiritual power, which hit directly onto Wèi WúXiàn’s weak spot.</p>
        <p>“Aaah... Agh... Lán Zhàn...” A sudden and intense pleasure travelled from his weak spot through his whole body, causing him to tremble uncontrollably.</p>
        <p>In fact, using spiritual power there was forbidden.</p>
        <p>Since he was always eager to try new techniques, Wèi WúXiàn had suggested it to Lán WàngJī. So, when the latter actually used it during their foreplay, Wèi WúXiàn found it too intense to bear. So, he wrote it to their Jingshi’s rules as a forbidden technique.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then looked at him, and, in a soothing voice, he said, “Wèi Yīng, leave everything to me.”</p>
        <p>Then, he moved down between Wèi WúXiàn’s legs, and took his already-upright manhood into his mouth.</p>
        <p>While performing fellatio on Wèi WúXiàn, Lán WàngJī alternately released gentle and strong stream of the spiritual power through his two fingers, which were still inside Wèi WúXiàn, and kept on arousing Wèi WúXiàn’s sexual pleasure.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī wanted to make Wèi WúXiàn’s “first time” be exceptionally an unforgettable experience.</p>
        <p>He wanted him to savour every of his moves inside him, to enjoy every pleasure that he gave him.</p>
        <p>He wanted him to experience great climaxes, to cry when he penetrated deeply inside him, and surrendered to him completely.</p>
        <p>He wanted him to feel him when he came inside him, and blended with him body and soul.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn... Lán Zhàn...” With the stream of the spiritual power hitting his P-spot, and his manhood being sucked, and, from time to time, the head got squeezed by the wall of Lán WàngJī’s throat, Wèi WúXiàn lost control and began to kick Lán WàngJī in the back.</p>
        <p>“My darling...” Wèi WúXiàn unconsciously said the words that he usually used when he begged for mercy. Then, his whole body convulsed, and, at the same, he released inside Lán WàngJī’s mouth.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī swallowed his fluid, pulled out his fingers from Wèi WúXiàn’s hole, and, vigorously, he inserted his huge manhood deeply inside him.</p>

        <br />
        <p>After releasing his white fluid, Wèi WúXiàn fell into state of languor, and Lán WàngJī, while he was still inside him, began the process of dual cultivation.</p>
        <p>Since, after losing a golden core, a new one could be formed within seven days, and there were still three days left, since Wèi WúXiàn went missing for two days, and was in a coma for another two days, Lán WàngJī decided to perform the dual cultivation without further delay.</p>
        <p>However, to begin the process of dual cultivation, Lán WàngJī needed to penetrate into the realm of Wèi WúXiàn’s conscious mind. Once inside, he began to channel through it using his spiritual power.</p>
        <p>While channelling, Lán WàngJī could see in Wèi WúXiàn’s memories a series of images of what happened around Wèi WúXiàn since he woke up this morning, as well as the people he met and told to, including himself.</p>
        <p>Entering the realm of the conscious mind was similar to the empathy, where you invited the spirit of a deceased person to enter your body in order to penetrate into their memory.</p>
        <p>Once the spirit of the dead was inside you, you would be able to hear what they heard, observe what they saw, and feel what they felt. This process helped in discovering information that only the deceased person knew about it.</p>
        <p>Although both, empathy and channelling, were similar, however, the process of a spirit entering your body was much easier compared to the process of penetrating into the realm of someone’s conscious mind.</p>
        <p>This was because the deceased people no longer possessed the spiritual veins*.</p>
        <small>*In Chinese martial arts, spiritual veins, also known as meridians, are believed to be the paths in which the life-energy known as Qi flows. In this story, Qi is the spiritual power.</small>
        <p>Inside the living beings, spiritual veins forged a barrier that protected the realm of the conscious mind, hence, preventing anyone from invading other people’s mind. Even for ordinary people with low spiritual power, their conscious minds were also protected.</p>
        <p>However, with his brilliant mind, Wèi WúXiàn succeeded in finding an easy method to enter the realm of the conscious mind, where other cultivators before him had tried but failed.</p>
        <p>He had found out that during the intercourse, people became defenceless due to the intense pleasure. So, at that crucial moment, using the semen as the medium, they could overcome that barrier, and penetrate into the realm of the conscious mind to perform the channelling.</p>
        <p>This process also required the one who wanted to penetrate into the other’s conscious mind to enter their own conscious mind first.</p>
        <p>Once you were inside the realm of your partner’s conscious mind, and began to channel, you would be able to detect the most important paths of the spiritual veins.</p>
        <p>Beyond the realm of the conscious mind was the realm of the unconscious mind.</p>
        <p>If you channelled deeper and penetrated into the realm of your partner’s unconscious mind, you would be able to discover their deepest desire, even modify their habits.</p>
        <p>If you were a high-level cultivator, you would be to control the flow of your partner’s spiritual power, which streamed through the spiritual veins.</p>
        <p>However, to be able to gain access to the realm of the unconscious mind required your partner to have an absolute trust in you, otherwise, you would be rejected, instinctively.</p>
        <p>Before Wèi WúXiàn went missing, while they were performing the dual cultivation, Lán WàngJī was able to see the flow of Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual power through his spiritual veins, without entering the realm of Wèi WúXiàn’s unconscious mind.</p>
        <p>This was because the level of Lán WàngJī’s cultivation was the most powerful. And also, the using of his semen was not only to pass through the barrier, but also to help them blend together their conscious minds.</p>
        <p>Since Wèi WúXiàn did no longer have his golden core, which generated a high amount of the spiritual power, Wèi WúXiàn’s current spiritual power became as weak as an ordinary person.</p>
        <p>So, after spotting the flow of Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual power, Lán WàngJī used his own spiritual power to guide the flow through the spiritual veins.</p>
        <p>He also opened up the main paths of Wèi WúXiàn ‘s spiritual veins. Hence, the whole process took less effort to be completed.</p>
        <p>After the channelling, Lán WàngJī was certain that in near future, a golden core would begin to form inside Wèi WúXiàn’s golden core vessel, that there was no need to enter his unconscious mind.</p>
        <p>During the channelling, Lán WàngJī saw himself in the memories of Wèi WúXiàn, when, one evening, both of them were in Jingshi, and he was reading a book aloud for Wèi WúXiàn. It was Wèi WúXiàn’s favourite story. When he finished, he told him to go to bed since Wèi WúXiàn became sleepy.</p>
        <p>After that channelling, Lán WàngJī found out that Wèi WúXiàn’s usual sleeping time had changed, as well as his favourite sentence of the story.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī believed that he was the one who caused these changes during the channelling, because his spiritual power was much stronger than that of Wèi WúXiàn, and, as a result, he tampered with Wèi WúXiàn’s habits.</p>
        <p>Since channelling through the realm of the unconscious mind could allowed one to alter the other’s wishes and habits, Lán WàngJī didn’t want these kind of things to happen to Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Therefore, during their dual cultivation, they always operated in the realm of the conscious mind, and, step by step, they worked together to accomplish their goal.</p>
        <p>However, Wèi WúXiàn was not as cautious as Lán WàngJī was, he said, “Ér Gege*, I trust you. So, you can go deeper and enter the realm of my unconscious mind. In that way, you’ll be able to accelerate the whole process.”</p>
        <small>*Since ‘Second Brother’ sounds weird in English language, from now on Ér Gege will be used instead. The correct pronunciation of Ér Gege is on the sidebar.</small>
        <p>Seeing that Lán WàngJī was not happy about his suggestion, Wèi WúXiàn did not insist.</p>
        <p>He then put his arms around Lán WàngJī’s neck, and, in a coquettish way, he said, “Ér Gege, don’t worry. It’s fine if you don’t want to do it. Just help me open up the main paths of my spiritual veins, I’ll do the rest. I promise that I’ll work hard to strengthen my foundation.”</p>
        <p>However, after Wèi WúXiàn went missing, Lán WàngJī blamed himself for being so cautious at that time. If only he had listened to Wèi WúXiàn, and entered his unconscious mind to help him quickly form a golden core, and solidify it, Wèi WúXiàn’s life would not be at stake.</p>
        <p>On that day, when he had traced Wèi WúXiàn’s signal-transmitter talisman, and only found Suíbiàn with the baby girl, for a moment, his mind went blank. Instinctively, he knew that something had happened to Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>And, during those two days of searching him, Lán WàngJī had tried hard to focus his spiritual power on WàngJī, despite being in constant agony.</p>
        <p>Somehow, he was sure that Wèi WúXiàn was still alive, but he was afraid that it would take long to find him, just like last time.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī knew that he would not bear to spend another long periods of waiting for him to return. So, from now on, he would not let him be out of his sight again, and keep protecting him day and night.</p>
        <p>At the time he was found, his Wèi Yīng was chilled to the bone, the same Wèi Yīng whom he pampered every day, and kept him warm every time he felt cold. But, for two days, his Wèi Yīng was soaked in the cold river without him being by his side to keep him warm.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī swore to make up for it. And also, he decided that from now on, he would listen to him, and let him do whatever it pleased him to do.</p>

        <br />
        <p>Since Wèi WúXiàn’s new golden core had shattered into pieces, and scattered in his spiritual veins, the only way to gather all the fragments was to penetrate into the realm of his unconscious mind.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s current spiritual power was too weak to collect those fragments, and form a golden core on its own within three days.</p>
        <p>And, if the fragments of his golden core happened to melt completely in his spiritual veins, it would be no longer possible to form another golden core.</p>
        <p>During their dual cultivation, since Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual power was weak, Lán WàngJī was using his own spiritual power to guide the flow of Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual power.</p>
        <p>However, by doing so, their both spiritual powers blended together, and, as a result, when the new golden core was formed, its properties were similar to the properties of Lán WàngJī’s golden core.</p>
        <p>That was why Suíbiàn recognised Lán WàngJī as its owner instead of Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī knew that, in order to gather all the fragments of Wèi WúXiàn’s golden core, he had to penetrate into the realm of Wèi WúXiàn’s unconscious mind, then use again his semen as the medium to blend their unconscious minds, as well as their spiritual powers.</p>
        <p>And, since their golden cores shared the same properties, Lán WàngJī would use his golden core to trace those fragments that were scattered in Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual veins.</p>
        <p>When he would enter his unconscious mind and begin to channel, Lán WàngJī might discover Wèi WúXiàn’s most desire, as well as watching the images of Wèi WúXiàn’s deepest memories.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn had fallen asleep. However, Lán WàngJī really wanted to enter his unconscious mind while he was awake. He wanted him to reach yet another climax, blended their souls and bodies together.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he began to dive deeper, then succeeded in penetrating into the realm of Wèi WúXiàn unconscious mind.  Once inside, he closed his eyes for a moment to listen to the flow of Wèi WúXiàn’s spiritual power, then, he opened his eyes and began to channel.</p>
        <p>Inside Wèi WúXiàn’s unconscious mind was all dark and silent, like being in an empty space deprived of any source of light and sound. It was so quiet that Lán WàngJī could even hear his own breath and heartbeat.</p>
        <p>It seemed like a long time had passed before Lán WàngJī began to hear some whispers.</p>
        <p>Those faint voices seemed to come from far, travelling like a gentle breeze at first, then, gradually, they became distinct and abundant.</p>
        <p>The voices appeared to be some fragments of Wèi WúXiàn’s memories, coming all over the place in a chaotic manner.</p>
        <p>In order to distinguish every speech of these voices, Lán WàngJī closed his eyes again and began to concentrate.</p>
        <p>Then, by focusing on one memory, he recognised the scene; Wèi WúXiàn and he were in Cold Spring of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, back when they were teenagers.</p>
        <p>“Stop splashing around.” “But water is so cold.” “What are you doing?” “I’m just coming towards where you are, because water is warmer around you.”</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī caught another scene; it was when Wèi WúXiàn confessed his love to him.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn! Lán WàngJī! HánGuāng-Jūn! Earlier, I sincerely wanted to sleep with you!” “Lán Zhàn, listen to me.” “I really have a bad memory. I don’t remember everything that happened in the past, included that night .”</p>
        <p>“You are really wonderful. I like you.” “In other words, I love you. I want you. I can’t bear to be parted from you. ” “I want to spend the rest of my life Night-Hunting with you.”</p>
        <p>“I want to sleep with you every single day.”  “I swear I’m not teasing you like I did before, nor expressing my gratitude to you.” “It’s simply because I love you.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t want anyone unless it’s you.” “It can’t be anyone but you.” “You can do whatever you want with me, as long as you are willing to be with me.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then carried on listening to another deepest memory of Wèi WúXiàn, and then another, and so on, until he suddenly released that Wèi WúXiàn’s memories were all about him.</p>
        <p>That would explained why his Wèi Yīng remembered ‘WàngXiàn’, the name of the tune he hummed to him earlier. Although Wèi WúXiàn knew the tune since they were teenagers, however, he didn’t know the name back then.</p>
        <p>That would also explained why his Wèi Yīng was able to read his facial expression, and felt his pain this morning. Even though Wèi WúXiàn’s memories were gone, however, his feeling for him was still there.</p>
        <p>And, in turn, this would explained why his Wèi Yīng could naturally touch him and let be touched by him, as well as trusting him completely; he felt at ease by his side to the extent that he could easily and deeply fall asleep.</p>
        <p>That why his Wèi Yīng fell in love with him again.</p>
        <p>Also, his Wèi Yīng had promised him that, from now on, he would remember everything he would do or say to him, that he wouldn’t any longer forget any of them.</p>
        <p>Hence, all these precious memories were still there, deep in his unconscious mind.</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī carried on channelling further, the voices gradually faded away. And, soon, he reached the core Wèi WúXiàn’s unconscious mind.</p>
        <p>In front of him, there was some sort of cave, and the inside of that cave was dimly lighted.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī stepped into the cave, and saw two people, one was Wèi WúXiàn, sitting on the floor with his back leaned against the wall, and the other was himself, half-knelt in front of Wèi WúXiàn, and both of them were covered with blood.</p>
        <p>The other Lán WàngJī was holding Wèi WúXiàn’s hands, and, earnestly, he was saying something to him. However, Lán WàngJī could not catch anything of what the other him was saying.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then walked closer to them in order to hear what the other him was saying to Wèi WúXiàn, but, still, his attempt was in vain.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, however, he was able to see such a tenderness in Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes as he looked at the other him. He also heard him saying in a gentle voice, “All right, Lán Zhàn, I will go with you. Please, take me home.”</p>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn tenderly put his both hands on the other Lán WàngJī’s cheeks, and began to repeat his words. As he did so, his voice was getting louder, while his tone becoming resolved.</p>
        <p>Then, finally, he shouted, “Lán Zhàn, take me to GūsūLán!”</p>
        <p>And, all of a sudden, their surroundings was replaced with a beautiful scenery full of colourful flowers and luxuriant green grass.</p>
        <p>As for Lán WàngJī, he was filled with happiness by these simple words. No wonder his Wèi Yīng said this morning, “I won’t go. If you don’t want me to go, then I’ll stay with you.”</p>
        <p>Earlier, he felt a little bit disappointed because instead of a silence from Wèi WúXiàn, he was expecting another vehement confession.</p>
        <p>“How foolish I was!” thought Lán WàngJī, “I no longer need any proof of love from Wèi Yīng. His shouted words just now was the best* confession.”</p>
        <small>*Before Wèi WúXiàn’s death, Lán WàngJī has pestered him to come with him to GūsūLán, (that was his clumsy way of saying ‘I love you’ to Wèi WúXiàn). And now, finally, Wèi WúXiàn returns his feeling by saying ‘Take me to GūsūLán’.</small>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng.” in his deep voice, Lán WàngJī called him to get his attention.</p>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn turned his head and looked at him. Meanwhile, the other Lán WàngJī began to fade away.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then positioned himself at the exact place the other him was, and held Wèi WúXiàn’s hands, while Wèi WúXiàn appeared to be stunned.</p>
        <p>In a voice full of tenderness, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, I’ll take you with me back to GūsūLán.”</p>
        <p>Then, with a bright smile on his face, Wèi WúXiàn quickly hugged Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī also embraced him in his arms. And, when Wèi WúXiàn raised his head towards him, they fondly kissed each other.</p>
        <p>After their kisses, the scenery changed again. Now, they were in Jingshi.</p>
        <p>In their room, Bìchén and Suíbiàn were hanged on the wall, some music notes were on the table, and their shelf was filled with various books and rare objects that Wèi WúXiàn brought home whenever he visited a place.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then carried Wèi WúXiàn to the bed, and then, he slowly removed Wèi WúXiàn’s clothes, then, he did the same with his clothes.</p>
        <p>Once both of them were naked, Lán WàngJī lay on the top of Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng.” He gently began to call him again and again, while caressing his soft skin. They were in perfect harmony, blended by the love they felt for each other.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then closed his eyes, and released a flow of his spiritual power. The blue light spread like circular ripples, then, some gentle notes of music, which seemed to be emitted by Wangji, filled the room.</p>
        <p>Soon after, the fragments of Wèi WúXiàn’s golden core slowly began to gather until they formed a perfect and shiny golden sphere.</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī guided the golden core to Wèi WúXiàn’s golden core vessel.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <br />
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn slowly opened his eyes, he didn’t straight away notice that it was already morning, because the bed curtains were blocking out the sunlight.</p>
        <p>When he drew the curtains, the lovely sunshine shone in his eyes, and made him squint.</p>
        <p>Not yet fully awake, Wèi WúXiàn inwardly said, while still holding the curtains, “This fabric is expensive to the touch.”</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, he became aware of what happened the night before,  “Wait a minute! If this room is Jingshi, then, that means that it was not a dream!”</p>
        <p>He then pushed away the blanket so to examine his body, and noticed here and there some red marks of love bites.</p>
        <p>“These marks mean that...” Wèi WúXiàn was trying to find his words, while his mind was in state of amazement, “...that Lán Zhàn and I did it! We really slept together!”</p>
        <p>He carried on, “Why Lán Zhàn is so awesome? Not only he is very good-looking, but also...” Wèi WúXiàn felt shy* to finish his sentence, he then added, “Lán Zhàn is really good at everything.”</p>
        <small>*but also he is good in bed.</small>
        <p>Then, he realised, “Wait! Something feels different inside me. It’s a golden core! How strange is that, at my waking up, to find that I have a golden core!”</p>
        <p>“I’ll let it be for now.” he decided, “Sooner or later, things will clear up. Right now, I have something else in mind.”</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn said that we are a married couple.”, for a short period of time, the last two words resonated inside his head.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn carried on, “He also said, ‘Wèi Yīng, in BǎiFèngShān, it was me who kissed you.’. It was really an amazing surprise to learn that Lán Zhàn has started to like me since back then.”</p>
        <p>Then, he kept on recalling what Lán WàngJī said to him,“’Wèi Yīng, I love you.’ That is just too much.” Wèi WúXiàn was already overexcited.</p>
        <p>“‘Wèi Yīng, I want you. Doing it only once is not enough.’ Lán Zhàn actually said something like that to me!”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn had wrapped the blanket around him from head to toe, and carried on replaying every single word Lán WàngJī said, and, at the time, he was rolling on the bed like a child.</p>
        <p>From time to time, he would suppress an overjoyed shriek by putting his hand over his mouth.</p>
        <p>Upon entering the room, Lán WàngJī saw something resembled a giant caterpillar-like that was twisting and turning on the bed, which made him smile a little bit.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then put on the table some dishes that he brought along before walking to the bed.</p>
        <p>He bent down and said, “Wèi Yīng, you woke up? Do you want to eat...”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī didn’t finish talking that Wèi WúXiàn spread out the blanket, covered Lán WàngJī’s upper body, pulled him on the bed, and then, he jumped on top of him.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then tossed away the blanket, and began to touch Lán WàngJī’s body, then, he attempted to remove his clothes.</p>
        <p>However, Lán WàngJī began to resist, and said, “Great warrior, please, spare my life.”</p>
        <p>“My little angel, I won’t take your life. I just want to deflower you.” replied Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>He then resumed on trying to remove Lán WàngJī’s clothes. However, Lán WàngJī put his arms across his chest. With his mighty strength, Wèi WúXiàn was unable to pull off his clothes.</p>
        <p>“Great warrior, I already have someone I like.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then asked, “Can I be the one you like?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī appeared to think carefully about it, then, he replied, “Why not. It doesn’t make any difference.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn looked at him with surprise, then, he burst into loud laughter. When he was done laughing, in short interval, he gave Lán WàngJī two very light kisses, as though he was a butterfly landing on Lán WàngJī’s lips.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then hugged him, and rolled over so to be on the top, and then, he deeply kissed him. A long and deep kiss that made them pant afterwards.</p>
        <p>“Why are you so happy?” asked Lán WàngJī after a short while.</p>
        <p>“That’s because, when I woke up, I found out that you are mine. So, naturally, I’m happy.” Then, he added, “Come on, give your great warrior another treat.”</p>
        <p>After the treat, Lán WàngJī told him to eat while food was still warm.</p>
        <p>Shortly, after a quick wash, Wèi WúXiàn was sitting at the table, removing the lids from the plates to see what Lán WàngJī had brought.</p>
        <p>There were shredded chicken, a bowl of congee topped with roasted chestnuts, fried vegetables, some hash brows, deep-fried lotus roots, a bowl of soup with boiled egg, and a few side dishes.</p>
        <p>“Wow! They look very appetising. Lán Zhàn, did you cook all these dishes?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.” Lán WàngJī replied.</p>
        <p>“You really made all this for me? I’m so happy!”</p>
        <p>Then, while devouring his breakfast, Wèi WúXiàn was praising Lán WàngJī for his cooking skills, and, alternately, he was asking him a series of questions.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, what other dishes can you cook? Mmm, it’s really yummy, and they are all my favourites.”</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, when have you actually started to like me? And, who confessed first? Ah! Of course, it was me. It had to be me.”</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, how long have we been living together? And, why are you so well versed in bed?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī didn’t answer any of Wèi WúXiàn’s questions, instead he asked, “Wèi Yīng, do you feel any change in your body?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then said, “Ah! That’s right! Lán Zhàn, I formed a golden core.”</p>
        <p>Then, while smiling, he took the end part of Lán WàngJī’s forehead ribbon, and began to fidget with it.</p>
        <p>“Just by playing with me only once, I was able to form a golden core.” he said, “Lán Zhàn, why are you so amazing? How about playing with me once more?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī, however, introduced another topic, “Wèi Yīng, is your body all right? Do you feel any discomfort?”</p>
        <p>“Huh? Not at all. I’m fine.” replied Wèi WúXiàn, “Why are you  asking about it? Are you worried that you might have injured me?”</p>
        <p>Then, he added, “To be honest, your techniques are really good. I was fully satisfied.”</p>
        <p>“When I woke up this morning, I examined your golden core vessel, and noted that everything was perfectly fine, included your golden core.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>He carried on “Since you had not mentioned it earlier, I thought that you had not sensed the golden core at all. So, I was worried that something was wrong with the golden core.”</p>
        <p>With a warm smile, Wèi WúXiàn said, “The golden core is not more important than you are to me. I first of all care about you, well, about us, I should say.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī was stunned, and slowly repeating Wèi WúXiàn’s words in his head, “The golden core...is not more important...than you are to me.”</p>
        <p>Then, he recalled what the doctor said after he had examined Wèi WúXiàn, “Wèi-gōngzǐ* triggered the self-explosion of the golden core in order to use the energy of the explosion to form a protection around his body.</p>
        <small>*gōngzǐ is a honorific title addressed to a son of a noble family.</small>
        <p>“Thus, Wèi-gōngzǐ survived the violent turmoil of the waves without major injuries.</p>
        <p>“If a golden core breaks, no matter how big or small the fragments are, there’s still a possibility to repair it.</p>
        <p>“However, a golden core that is shattered by activating its self-explosion might be impossible to repair, and also, it is unlikely that another golden core can be formed.</p>
        <p>“An ordinary cultivator would never opt for such decisive measures. Wèi-gōngzǐ’s strong will to survive, his decision on the spot and his ability to endure pain are really remarkable, and very different from ordinary people.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī began to think, “I know how a golden core means to Wèi Yīng. However, he chose to give up on it with the risk of no longer be able to form another one..</p>
        <p>And, above all, knowing how painful you could feel, if you activate the self-explosion of your golden core, still, Wèi Yīng decided to bear such extreme pain in order to survive and return by my side.</p>
        <p>“In his decision, Wèi Yīng was certainly sure that I would find him, as well as finding a way to restore his golden core.</p>
        <p>“If I had failed to find him within seven days, then there would be no way of forming another golden core.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then imagined what Wèi WúXiàn might have said while taking his decision, “Lán Zhàn, I won’t die. I won’t let you down and make you wait like last time.”</p>
        <p>“I really want to be inside him, right now.” said Lán WàngJī inwardly, while looking at Wèi WúXiàn intensively, “All day of yesterday, I had longed to hold him, feel his naked body against mine.</p>
        <p>“However, it’s nothing compared to the desire I have right now. I want to tear his clothes off, and penetrate deeply inside him, blending our bodies and souls.”</p>
        <p>Puzzled by Lán WàngJī’s prolonged silence, Wèi WúXiàn, who was still eating his breakfast, asked without raising his head , “Lán Zhàn, why are you so quiet?”</p>
        <p>Then, he looked at him and, at once, Wèi WúXiàn was astonished by what he observed.</p>
        <p>After his surprise had passed, Wèi WúXiàn stretched his leg towards Lán WàngJī, and, with his toes, he began to rub Lán WàngJī’s leg, he teasingly asked, “Lán Zhàn, are you a little bit... uh... horny, right now?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī’s eyes was burning hot, he replied, “You have suggested it yourself.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn kept on invitingly rubbing Lán WàngJī’s leg, and, while smiling, he asked, “What did I say?”</p>
        <p>In a hoarse voice, Lán WàngJī replied.“You said: ‘How about playing with me one more time.’” </p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn laughed heartily, then, he spread his arms towards Lán WàngJī, letting the latter know that he could carry him to the bed.</p>
        <p>So, he did in a hurry, then, impatiently, he tore Wèi WúXiàn’s trousers off.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn noted that this time Lán WàngJī was a little bit ruthless, he said, “Lán Zhàn, am I overthinking? Are you not becoming more rough, after deflowering me? Argh!”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s words had often such a powerful effect on Lán WàngJī by adding fuel to the fire.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī had inserted his fingers inside Wèi WúXiàn’s hole, and, rapidly, he quickened the movements of his fingers, he asked, after biting Wèi WúXiàn’s lower lip, “Can I not be rough?”</p>
        <p>“Ahaa... of course, you can. You can do whatever you want. However, you are not allowed to use that technique again, like yesterday... argh.” replied Wèi WúXiàn while he was moaning between his sentences.</p>
        <p>“Which technique?” Lán WàngJī asked, and, at the time, he pulled out his fingers, then, fiercely, he inserted his manhood, which was already hard like a rock.</p>
        <p>“Argh... Lán Zhàn... why you have to be that ruthless and impatient?”</p>
        <p>Taking his both hands, Lán WàngJī placed them above Wèi WúXiàn’s head, then, he intertwined his fingers with Wèi WúXiàn’s fingers, and then, feverishly, he began to move back and forth.</p>
        <p>He then leaned close to Wèi WúXiàn’s ear, his warm breath was like a caress on his ear, he said while he kept on bumping, “Wèi Yīng, you are mine.”</p>
        <p>“Argh... Lán Zhàn... I am completely yours.”</p>
        <p>When he woke up, Wèi WúXiàn praised Lán WàngJī for his techniques in bed. However, he didn’t expect that, with the most simple position, Lán WàngJī could make him feel so extremely good, he said, “Argh... Ér Gege... it’s too deep.”</p>
        <p>“How does it feel compared to last night?” asked Lán WàngJī .</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, last night, Lán WàngJī didn’t go all the way down inside Wèi WúXiàn, as the latter thought.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, relax a little bit.”</p>
        <p>“Argh... but you’re moving too fast. What did you eat to have such stamina?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī progressively rose Wèi WúXiàn’s buttocks, hitting every inch inside of Wèi WúXiàn’s hole.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn is like an overlord right now, making me feel powerless and submissive.” said Wèi WúXiàn inwardly.</p>
        <p>This time, no special techniques were used, however Wèi WúXiàn felt that he would faint if Lán WàngJī kept on moving at such a speed.</p>
    </div>

        <br />
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn had fallen asleep soon after their love-making. When he woke up, it was already afternoon.</p>
        <p>However, Lán WàngJī and himself were not in hurry to get out of bed. Moreover, they affectionately spooned together as they lied on the bed.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then told Wèi WúXiàn everything about their dual cultivation.</p>
        <p>“Oh! No wonder why after doing it with you, I sense that my spiritual power becomes more stronger.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>He carried, “So, if I followed correctly, you used your semen as a medium and passed through the spiritual veins barrier, then penetrated into my unconscious mind, and helped me restore my golden core.”</p>
        <p>“Wow!” Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “I am really amazing to have come up with that method.”</p>
        <p>Then, he turned to face Lán WàngJī, and began to stroke his thighs. Lán WàngJī slightly patted the hand that fondled him.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then moved his hand up to Lán WàngJī’s chest, and slid it under Lán WàngJī’s clothe, “Lán Zhàn, your muscles are really toned.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then held the hand that moved about his chest, brought it to his lips, and tenderly kissed the back of Wèi WúXiàn’s hand.</p>
        <p>Dissatisfied, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, I haven’t finished touching you.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then kissed him passionately, sucking his tongue, as well as his lower lip to the extent that it went numb.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, since last night he had been kissed so many times, Wèi WúXiàn began to respond more actively.</p>
        <p>And also, taking the initiative, he deeply inserted his tongue into Lán WàngJī’s mouth, then, continuously twisting his tongue around Lán WàngJī’s tongue.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī, however, still held the lead, he kissed him to the point where Wèi WúXiàn felt that all his strength had deserted his body.</p>
        <p>Still, Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, once more, slid underneath Lán WàngJī’s clothe and stroked his chest.</p>
        <p>“Are you hungry?” asked Lán WàngJī as he sat up.</p>
        <p>“I’m not really hungry. ” Wèi WúXiàn replied, then, enthusiastically, he asked, “Are you going to cook again?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “I can make something simple, since we don’t have enough time.”</p>
        <p>“Can you make some plain noodle soup?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.</p>
        <p>“Okay.” Lán WàngJī replied, then, he kissed Wèi WúXiàn once more, got out of bed, picked up their clothes that were scattered on the floor, and hanged them on the dressing screen.</p>
        <p>Then, he went behind the dressing screen. When he came out, he was once again fully dressed, and left the room.</p>
        <p>Shortly after, he returned with two bowls of plain noddle soup.</p>
        <p>Even though it was a simple recipe, Lán WàngJī still made the dishes pleasing to the eye.</p>
        <p>Besides noddles, he had added some slices of lotus root, shredded chicken, pickled mustard greens and fresh vegetables. All these toppings were nicely arranged inside the bowl.</p>
        <p>The ingredients were similar to that of the breakfast, however, the flavour was completely different.</p>
        <p>After eating the tasty noddle soup, Wèi WúXiàn was in high spirits, “Lán Zhàn, I have been pondering about the channelling technique that you told me. I think that it might be the cause of my amnesia.”</p>
        <p>He carried on, “Since there are many memories residing in the realm of the conscious mind, having another conscious mind penetrating inside might destabilise the conscious mind of the host.</p>
        <p>“This issue must have slipped out of my attention, while the golden core vessel was accumulating a lot of energy in order to stabilise itself before the formation of the golden core.</p>
        <p>“However, I formed a golden core so suddenly, then, shortly after, I lost it. Meanwhile, the golden core vessel was still unstable, the realm of my conscious mind was also unstable, hence, the issue of memory loss arose.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “When I found you, you had used the spiritual power to protect yourself, especially your head.</p>
        <p>“Except from the injury on your leg that you had before being washed away, there was no other internal or external injuries. Therefore, the doctor could not find the cause of your amnesia.”</p>
        <p>“Well, my reasoning is quite fair. Even though you have already used that kind of, oh...” Wèi WúXiàn paused.</p>
        <p>Then, he suddenly smiled and winked at Lán WàngJī, “That kind of invading the conscious mind is likely to influence the host’s habits. Lán Zhàn, you are right about the channelling consequences.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then held Lán WàngJī’s hand, and said, “I have the feeling that you have been blaming yourself for not entering the realm of my unconscious mind earlier, in order to help me form my golden core.</p>
        <p>“But, Lán Zhàn, what told me was right. Without repeatedly testing a new technique, and carelessly using it could bear some serious consequences.</p>
        <p>“This time I was lucky to lose only one part of my memories. What if I have lost all of my memories, and unable to recover them again?  Or, even worst, having a memory dysfunction, then, what would become of me?”</p>
        <p>He carried on, this time, with a smile, “I think it was a good fortune that you had insisted on penetrating only the realm of my conscious mind, and help me open up the main points of my spiritual veins. Doing so, you have gradually let me get used to your spiritual power.</p>
        <p>“If you had directly entered the realm of my unconscious mind, my spiritual veins and golden core vessel might have not coped with a surge of your spiritual power, which, in turn, could have caused another issues.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī remained silent, while he got close to Wèi WúXiàn, embraced him in his arms, and rested his chin on Wèi WúXiàn’s head.</p>
        <p>Then, he felt Wèi WúXiàn’s hand patting his back, like comforting a child.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn held Lán WàngJī’s hand again, and placed it on his stomach, just below the belly button, then, he said, “It is one thing to form a golden core, but another to solidify it.</p>
        <p>“At this stage, we don’t fully understand the risks involved in our method. And other cultivators have their own way of forming a golden core.</p>
        <p>“You have helped me build the foundation. To play it safe, from now on, I will rely on my own spiritual power to do the rest.”</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, Wèi WúXiàn laughed, “Lán Zhàn, the way I put your hand on my stomach, does it not look like I am pregnant of your child, and letting you feel the baby’s movement?”</p>
        <p>Finally, a smile seemed to have appeared on Lán WàngJī’s face, he replied, “It does.”</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, you are now playing along with my joking about. This is just unbelievable.”</p>
        <p>“I have become accustomed to it.” Lán WàngJī replied, then, he rose Wèi WúXiàn’s head and tenderly kissed him.</p>
        <p>This time, Lán WàngJī took his time. He slowly licked Wèi WúXiàn’s lips, then, he softly sucked them. His way of kissing him was like treasuring the most valuable possession he had.</p>
        <p>As for Wèi WúXiàn, the kiss seemed to have some aphrodisiac effects on him.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī’s kiss felt so good that, when he let go of his lips, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t want it to end just yet, he moved upward and fervently began to kiss Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>After the kisses, Lán WàngJī said, “I’m going to inform Xiōng-zhǎng and the doctor that your golden core has been restored.”  then, he asked, “Wèi Yīng, will you come with me?”</p>
        <p>“Of course, I’ll go with you.” he replied.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn needed to change clothes, since he was still wearing his nightclothes. So, Lán WàngJī went to the wardrobe, and, when he was about to take Wèi WúXiàn’s usual black clothes, he suddenly changed his mind.</p>
        <p>Instead of Wèi WúXiàn’s black robes, Lán WàngJī took out a set of GūsūLán clan uniform. The garments were not the formal ones, but still, they were not easy to be worn.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn usually thought that wearing GūsūLán clothes meant to keep them clean at all times, which meant, according to himself, not to be able to move freely as you would wish to. Hence, he would rather wear black garments.</p>
        <p>Although his black clothes also had the curl cloud motifs of GūsūLán, still, they were not eye-catching.</p>
        <p>“Do I usually wear these kind of clothes?” he asked, “They look very complex. I won’t be able to wear them properly.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī didn’t reply, but only said, “I’ll help you put them on.”</p>
        <p>He then did what he said, and, for the final touch, he wrapped the waist-belt around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist.</p>
        <p>As he watched Lán WàngJī helping me, Wèi WúXiàn chuckled, then, he said, “Yesterday, I didn’t fasten the belt wrongly. You purposely said so in order to do it yourself.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī only said, “I’ll comb your hair.”</p>
        <p>“You also wanted to comb my hair, didn’t you?” Wèi WúXiàn asked, then, he added, “If you don’t answer, I won’t let you comb my hair.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī’s ears turned pink, he finally replied, “Yes.”</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, why are you so cute?” he teasingly said.</p>
        <p>Sitting in front of the mirror, Wèi WúXiàn looked at his appearance for a short while, then, he said, “It looks like my face has changed a little bit compared to yesterday.”</p>
        <p>“Yes.” Lán WàngJī agreed.</p>
        <p>Because of the formation of his golden core, Wèi WúXiàn’s face slowly changed into his former appearance.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, what do you like about me?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.</p>
        <p>“I like everything about you.” he replied.</p>
        <p>“Don’t you think that my previous face was more handsome than my current appearance?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “Appearance is superficial.”</p>
        <p>“Oh! I see.” said Wèi WúXiàn, “Since you were a kid, you look at your handsome face in the mirror every day, and think that I’m not good-looking.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then said, “Wèi Yīng, you are handsome.” then, he added, “I wish to be like you.”</p>
        <p>Extremely surprised, Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “Ah! Lán Zhàn, your words become jaw-dropping!”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī didn’t really care about Wèi WúXiàn’s appearance.</p>
        <p>However, when he finished tying up Wèi WúXiàn’s hair in ponytail, and fastening the forehead ribbon, Lán WàngJī’s heart skipped a beat by how gorgeous Wèi WúXiàn looked on GūsūLán clan uniform.</p>

        <br />
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, I am so elegantly dressed as though I’m going back to school, again.” then, he added, “I still remember what Lán Lǎo asked us as a question, back then:</p>
        <p>‘If an criminal has been executed, and his body has been exposed for seven days, and, as a result, his corpse has been filled with resentment, which methods would you use to deal with it?’”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī felt his chest tighten a little bit by this sensitive topic. However, he only said, “What would you do?”</p>
        <p>“First, purify its soul. Second, suppress it, if the first method fails. And, finally, if the second method also fails, annihilate it.” then, he added, “It’s what you replied. You’re always right.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then said, “There is a fourth method. It’s what you replied, and you were right.”</p>
        <p>“My method is precarious.” said Wèi WúXiàn, “Demonic power is very complex. There are some features that are good to be used, and others that are not, and must to be discarded.”</p>
        <p>He carried on, “Lán Zhàn, you have already helped me restore my golden core. From now on, I’ll be using mostly my spiritual power, and less of my demonic power.”</p>
        <p>He then leaned his head on Lán WàngJī’s shoulder, and gently stroked Lán WàngJī’s back. With a sweet smile on his face, he said, “Ér Gege, I’ll behave.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī remained silent, his well-behave Wèi Yīng once cut off his own golden core, then was trapped in the pit of burial ground. Back then, he used to stare at his back figure, feeling powerless for being unable to change the course of events.</p>
        <p>He also used to listen to Wèi WúXiàn saying that he didn’t had other choices than walking on the wrong side of the road.</p>
        <p>Now that he had a golden core, he no longer needed to walk on that side.</p>
        <p>They had worked together to form a new golden core, however, Wèi WúXiàn chose to give up on his golden core for him. Fortunately, he was able to help him restore his golden core.</p>
        <p>Right now, a dazzling golden core was residing in his golden core vessel. And, this time, he would protect him.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn had gone back to the mirror to look at himself again. He then saw in the mirror that Lán WàngJī had followed him.</p>
        <p>He watched Lán WàngJī via the mirror as the latter embraced him from the back.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn saw him closed his eyes, and noticed that his eyelashes trembled slightly.</p>
        <p>As Lán WàngJī’s face slowly got close to his, a warm breath caressed his forehead, then, affectionately, Lán WàngJī kissed his forehead.</p>
        <p>That one kiss was not enough to satisfy Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was still watching his every action via the mirror. He saw him leaning his head towards his face one more time, then, his lips gently brushed his cheek, like a touch of a dandelion clock.</p>
        <p>Even though his handsome darling had already made his heart beat fast many times before, this time, however, Wèi WúXiàn felt as though his heart would pop out of his chest.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn...” inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn called his name, then, he noticed in the mirror that his own face had turned scarlet like a red maple leaf.</p>
        <p>“Lán...” As he turned his head towards Lán WàngJī, in a low voice, Wèi WúXiàn began to call him ,but stopped abruptly when his lips brushed his sweetheart’s lips.</p>
        <p>For a while, they gazed at each other mesmerically.</p>
        <p>“His way of looking at me sets my body on fire.” thought Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then leaned his head, and began to kiss Wèi WúXiàn eagerly, licking and sucking his lips, exploring his mouth with the tip of his tongue.</p>
        <p>“Aaah...” Wèi WúXiàn felt some warm and comfortable sensation in his back, where Lán WàngJī’s hands were caressing him.</p>
        <p>He murmured, “In broad daylight, is it not indecent? How... how many times have we already done it?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī let go of his mouth, but kept on stroking his back. And, when he talked, his voice sounded a little bit guilty, “Wèi Yīng... I want you, once again.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn felt something hard and warm against his loins. Apparently, Lán WàngJī was not able to suppress his desire for him.</p>
        <p>After feeling Lán WàngJī’s manhood brushed against him, Wèi WúXiàn also became horny, and didn’t any long mind the daylight.</p>
        <p>Without hesitation, Wèi WúXiàn removed his trousers, then, he said, “Since you want me, then, let’s do it. I’ll receive you whenever you want me.”</p>
        <p>Then, he noticed that, in flash, Lán WàngJī ’s eyes became similar to those of a predator ready to jump on its prey, which frightened him a little bit.</p>
        <p>However, it was too late to draw back, as Lán WàngJī pushed him over the dressing table, then kicked aside the stool, which ended up turning over. And the sound produced by the fallen stool startled Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>And, at the same time, he could not believe his eyes, “What? He wants to do it right here, in front of the mirror!”</p>
        <p>To support himself, Wèi WúXiàn put his elbows on the dressing table. Then, he felt two slender fingers were swiftly inserted in his hole.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī vigorously moved his fingers inside Wèi WúXiàn, and, very soon, a watery sound was produced.</p>
        <p>Listening to the sound coming from his hole, Wèi WúXiàn was surprised by his own prompt reaction. And, before his “Be gentle” phrase could slip out of his mouth, he quickly swallowed it back.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then withdrew his fingers, and thrust the head of his huge stuff in Wèi WúXiàn’s hole.</p>
        <p>“Argh.” with a voice that sounded like a moan, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Are we not going to the bed?”</p>
        <p>“No, we’re not.” replied Lán WàngJī, then, he held Wèi WúXiàn by his waist, and, in a commanding tone, he said, “Wèi Yīng, raise you buttocks.”</p>
        <p>Since he had sensed a lack of patience in Lán WàngJī’s voice, Wèi WúXiàn obediently did what he was told. He lowered his upper body, which made it easy for him to raise his bottom, hence, giving himself completely to Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Without further delay, Lán WàngJī inserted his whole manhood inside Wèi WúXiàn, and, without showing any patience, he began to move back and forth.</p>
        <p>“Aaah... argh.” while moaning Wèi WúXiàn thought, “This is not way too fast?”</p>
        <p>Although they had just started, the sound produced by Lán WàngJī’s powerful thrusts indicated that Wèi WúXiàn’s hole swallowed him already in full.</p>
        <p>As the sound of their love-making could clearly be heard, Wèi WúXiàn thought that he got used to it too quickly, and felt a little bit defeated.</p>
        <p>Raising his head slightly, Wèi WúXiàn looked at their reflections in the mirror. His face was turned peach with his eyes looking steamy, while Lán WàngJī’s facial expression was still calm.</p>
        <p>“If you’re not looking at his back and forth movements, you won’t be able to guess what he is doing.” thought Wèi WúXiàn, then, with some malicious intention, he squeezed Lán WàngJī tight.</p>
        <p>As a result, Lán WàngJī let out a low and hoarse moan.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then became more naughty. He began to move his bottom in such a way to pleasure Lán WàngJī even more.</p>
        <p>Then, he asked, “Lán Zhàn, why your face is still unchanged? Am I not giving you a good service?”</p>
        <p>Although he was wearing the strict GūsūLán uniform, as well as the forehead ribbon that conveyed a self-control, Wèi WúXiàn’s temperament was still the same.</p>
        <p>As a result of Wèi WúXiàn’s naughtiness, Lán WàngJī, despite himself, tightened his grip on Wèi WúXiàn’s waist, and began to move even faster.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then could no longer moved his buttocks. Furthermore, his moans became louder.</p>
        <p>Looking in the mirror, Wèi WúXiàn watched his erotic expression as Lán WàngJī kept bumping inside him.</p>
        <p>Then, when he was about to say something else, Lán WàngJī spoke first, “Wèi Yīng, don’t speak.”</p>
        <p>Inwardly, Lán WàngJī said, “I can barely control myself, right now. If Wèi Yīng says something again, I won’t be able to control myself, which might afflict him some injuries.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn didn’t dare to say whatever he wanted to say. Unconsciously, each time Lán WàngJī used a dominant tone, he would quickly behave.</p>
        <p>In the mirror, their lower bodies were not reflected. The only reflection that could be seen was of two people wearing the same elegant GūsūLán clothes.</p>
        <p>‘Two wolves in sheep’s clothing.’ This thought suddenly crossed Wèi WúXiàn’s mind. He wanted to laugh, but he couldn’t because of Lán WàngJī’s fast and vigorous movements.</p>
        <p>However, it didn’t prevent him from thinking “This doggy style is indeed like being eaten by a fierce beast.” Though, his elegant husband was still looking like his usual self.</p>
        <p>Still, his jade colour-like face formed a contrast with his powerful back and forth motion. Only his burning eyes showed his passion.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn kept on thinking, “Lán Zhàn has a hidden side that he lets only me to see it.”</p>
        <p>Despite his waist being held tight, Wèi WúXiàn could sense Lán WàngJī’s feeling for him, “Lán Zhàn truly wants me. Since he is mine, I’ll give him everything he wants.”</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, deeply and fiercely penetrated, Wèi WúXiàn’s hole was filled with Lán WàngJī’s huge stuff. His hole tightened Lán WàngJī’s manhood, as he constantly moved inside Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn couldn’t help but kept on moaning for being extremely overwhelmed by the sexual climax.</p>
        <p>“This is not actually Lán WàngJī’s favourite position.” thought Wèi WúXiàn, “With this position, he can’t see the pleasure that he gives written on my face, or be able to kiss me.</p>
        <p>“Fortunately, via this mirror, he can still capture all the hot expressions on my face.</p>
        <p>“Also, having me dressed the GūsūLán uniform with the forehead ribbon, seems as though he has fulfilled a sweet dream.</p>
        <p>“For the last few days, he has undergone an extreme anxiety; worried that he would not find me, then worried that I have forgotten about us, worried that I’m no longer used to our physical intimacy, worried that he would fail to satisfy me.</p>
        <p>“Then, he’s worried about my golden core, worried about my health.</p>
        <p>“All these times, we have made love, Lán Zhàn has only one goal; make me feel fully satisfied.</p>
        <p>“Only this time, what he truly wants is to cast aside all his worries, he simply and purely wants me, nothing else but me.”</p>

        <br />
        <p>By channelling Wèi WúXiàn’s unconscious mind, Lán WàngJī discovered how much Wèi WúXiàn loved and cared about him.</p>
        <p>Recalling those memories, Lán WàngJī felt the strong emotion that made him lose control of himself, the feeling of being loved by the one he deeply loved, resulting in him making love to Wèi WúXiàn in the way that was too way fast and vigorous.</p>
        <p>Feeling overwhelmed by Lán WàngJī’s powerful back and forth movements, inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Is it because this is the first time we do the doggy style that it feels too intense?</p>
        <p>“Or, is it because of the way Lán Zhàn pecked me on the cheek that has set fire in me?</p>
        <p>“Or, is it because of the reflection of Lán Zhàn’s eyes in the mirror that shows how deep he loves and wants me?</p>
        <p>“Whatever it is, however, right now, making Lán Zhàn feel good will satisfy me more than anything else.”</p>
        <p>Then, as he could no longer hold it, Wèi WúXiàn released his white fluid while calling his darling’s name. And then, he lost consciousness and collapsed on the dressing table.</p>
        <p>Regaining his self-control as a result, Lán WàngJī, surprised, called him, “Wèi Yīng?”</p>
        <p>Somehow, he felt satisfied to see that his Wèi Yīng passed out because he made him feel so good. This satisfaction calmed down his burning desire for Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>He then pulled out his manhood, took the fallen stool, placed it back to its original place, and sat on it. Then, he took the unconscious Wèi WúXiàn, made him sit on his lap, with his face facing the mirror.</p>
        <p>As he did so, he also at the same time inserted his huge stuff inside Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Aagh...” Wèi WúXiàn let out a moan as the hot stuff penetrated inside his sensitive hole, causing him to regain consciousness.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn seemed to have heard Lán WàngJī chuckled faintly. Then, he realised that, this time, because of Lán WàngJī’s overpowered back and forth movements, he came too early.</p>
        <p>And, right now, he didn’t have any strength left, and all he could do was to rest complaisantly on Lán WàngJī’s arms, with head leaned against Lán WàngJī’s shoulder.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī had not started to move yet, he was quietly watching Wèi WúXiàn via the mirror, enjoying the steamy expression on his face.</p>
        <p>Becoming aware of being watched, Wèi WúXiàn felt a little bit shy. “Ér Gege.” he called as he raised his head towards Lán WàngJī’s face, with an expression on his face that said ‘kiss me’.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī lowered his head and began to kiss him, then, slowly, he started to move inside Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Uhh...” Wèi WúXiàn began to moan as Lán WàngJī hit his weak spot with each of his gentle forth movements, causing him to tremble slightly.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then let go of his mouth, and brought his lips close to Wèi WúXiàn’s ear, he asked, “You don’t like it?”</p>
        <p>“Ah!” inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “He really wants to hear me say ‘I like it’. Lán Zhàn is really naughty. He is actually more naughty when he is moving slowly than faster.”</p>
        <p>As Wèi WúXiàn didn’t replied, Lán WàngJī stopped moving, held Wèi WúXiàn’s chin, gently brought his lips close to his own lips, and gave him a long and deep kiss.</p>
        <p>Aroused by the kiss, Wèi WúXiàn involuntarily curled his toes as Lán WàngJī took his time in kissing him.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, even though Lán WàngJī was not moving, Wèi WúXiàn could still feel the heat of his hot stuff, he could clearly sense the regular pulse of his huge manhood along the wall of his hole. All this was driving him mad.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, move... move already.” Wèi WúXiàn pleaded, unable to bear this growing arousal.</p>
        <p>He could have done the up and down movements himself, if it was not for the pain he felt on his waist where Lán WàngJī had held him earlier.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, right now, all I want is to kiss you.” His voice was low and deep, which caused Wèi WúXiàn to surrender.</p>
        <p>He replied, “All right, then. Kiss me as much as you want.” He then warmly welcomed him, and the two of them kissed each other passionately.</p>
        <p>After the kisses, both were out of breath. Wèi WúXiàn then turned his head, and watched Lán WàngJī via the mirror. He noticed that Lán WàngJī’s chest was slightly moving up and down, swaying him a little bit.</p>
        <p>He also noted that, despite his calm expression, Lán WàngJī’s eyes betrayed the fierce emotion he was feeling. This emotion was extremely set on fire by their kisses.</p>
        <p>Just by watching Lán WàngJī’s eyes, Wèi WúXiàn became more horny than he already was. Then, he realised, and said, inwardly, “Lán Zhàn has not released yet.”</p>
        <p>Forgetting the pain on his waist, Wèi WúXiàn began to move his bottom up and down, squeezing Lán WàngJī from time to time.</p>
        <p>Then, in a provocative way, he said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, I won’t stop until you come.”</p>
        <p>As a result, Lán WàngJī, who earlier had calmed himself down, was once more losing control.</p>
        <p>He held Wèi WúXiàn by the waist and made him stand up, then, he stood up himself, and put the stool very close to the dressing table.</p>
        <p>And then, in a commanding tone, he said, “Put your hands on the dressing table and your knees on the stool.”</p>
        <p>“What?!” Wèi WúXiàn was shocked, “Do I have to?” It seemed to him that Lán WàngJī had more than one or two tricks up his sleeve.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī simply replied, “Yes.” with his eyes burning hot, while his voice remained calm.</p>
        <p>Inwardly, Wèi WúXiàn said to himself, “I should just do what he says. After all, I was the one who provoked him in the first place.”</p>
        <p>Then, he leaned his upper body over the dressing table, and put his knees on the stool. And then, in a low voice, he asked, “The stool would not be overturned?”</p>
        <p>As a reply, Lán WàngJī produced two blue string-like lights, and made them fasten themselves on the stool, so that one string was on one side of the stool while the other on the other side.</p>
        <p>Then, the other end of the strings penetrated through the floor and stuck there, firmly holding the stool.</p>
        <p>“String killing technique!” Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed inwardly, “Is it really okay to use that? This is definitely not Lán Zhàn’s style. It looks like his future self digs a hole, which is waiting for his current self to jump in.”</p>
        <p>Then, using his both thumbs, Lán WàngJī vigorously parted Wèi WúXiàn’s small open, inserted his manhood, then, he began to move.</p>
        <p>“Hah...” Wèi WúXiàn moaned. Although it was a similar position as before, however, since this time his knees were resting on the stool, it allowed Lán WàngJī to go deeper inside him, and hit his P-spot.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī also felt an intense sensation as Wèi WúXiàn’s legs were close together, which caused Wèi WúXiàn’s hole to tighten around his manhood and sucked him with every move he made.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s legs had already begun to tremble because of the pleasure he felt.</p>
        <p>It seemed that there was no need to secure the stool since Lán WàngJī held Wèi WúXiàn by the hips so that his knees would not weigh on the stool.</p>
        <p>Noticing this subtle consideration, Wèi WúXiàn was delighted, and spared no efforts to tease Lán WàngJī, “HánGuāng-Jūn, you have really made a great progress.</p>
        <p>“Not only you want to face the mirror while doing it, but also you want my bottom to be raised so that you have a full view of your thrusts. You have become shameless. What a waste for your upstanding sect.”</p>
        <p>Undisturbed, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you are also a member of GūsūLán sect.”</p>
        <p>Via the mirror, Wèi WúXiàn could see in Lán WàngJī’s eyes that the storm was coming. “Oh! That’s right! I am also part of GūsūLán sect.” he replied.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s acceptance of being a member of GūsūLán sect made Lán WàngJī feel really happy. And, because of the inconvenience of the posture, he wasn’t moving too fast.</p>
        <p>Moreover, his moderate back and forth movements allowed him to enjoy how Wèi WúXiàn was unable to bear the intense pleasure of being penetrated from behind.</p>
        <p>“Aargh... Ér Gege, have you not become bigger?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn had rested his upper body on the dressing table, and, right now, it was his whole body that was trembling as the inside of his hole was still very sensitive.</p>
        <p>Overwhelmed with pleasure, Wèi WúXiàn pleaded, “Lán Zhàn, can we take a break?”</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, you said earlier that you won’t stop until I release.” replied Lán WàngJī while he kept on moving at the same pace. Then, he added, “And also, I have just started moving.”</p>
        <p>“Haaah... Ér Gege, I take back what I have said. You are too big.”</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, one of GūsūLán rules says: ‘You cannot go back on your words’. Since you are a member of GūsūLán sect, you must comply with the GūsūLán rules.”</p>
        <p>“Is there such a rule?” asked Wèi WúXiàn, then, subconsciously, he murmured, “Is it the eighty seventh rule on the wall?”</p>
        <p>Surprised, Lán WàngJī paused, and asked, “Do you remember this rule?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was himself surprised. Back then, he had copied the GūsūLán rules so many times, still, he could not remember most of them clearly, let alone the order they appeared on the wall.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then understood that Wèi WúXiàn didn’t recall the rule, but said it without realising it himself. Still, it was enough to make Lán WàngJī feel fully satisfied.</p>
        <p>“He is indeed mine.” said Lán WàngJī inwardly, “Not only he has not forgotten about me, but also he can subconsciously remember the rules of GūsūLán.</p>
        <p>“At this point, I don’t think I won’t be able to restrain myself. I want to blender together our bodies and souls.”</p>

        <br />
        <p>Indeed, Lán WàngJī could no longer restrain his emotion, bumping hard and hitting Wèi WúXiàn’s weak spot, causing a turmoil inside his hole.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, how much do you remember the GūsūLán rules? Recite them.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“What?! Right now?” Wèi WúXiàn was really annoyed, “Yesterday, when I was reciting the rules you stopped me from doing so. And now, you want me to recite them!”</p>
        <p>Then, he asked, “Are you sure that you really want to hear me reciting the rules, while we are doing it, and still wearing the GūsūLán uniforms?”</p>
        <p>In a dominant tone, Lán WàngJī said, “Recite the GūsūLán rules.”</p>
        <p>Then, he gripped Wèi WúXiàn’s buttocks so hard that his fingers sunk into the flesh. Meanwhile, he kept on moving back and forth.</p>
        <p>“Aaah...” While moaning, Wèi WúXiàn cried out, “Don’t go so deep!”</p>
        <p>Since Wèi WúXiàn still had not started to recite the rules, Lán WàngJī gave him a slap on his buttocks.</p>
        <p>“Ah!” surprised, Wèi WúXiàn said inwardly, “Did Lán Zhàn slap me or gave me a pat? It was so gentle that I’m not sure which one was.”</p>
        <p>In a deep voice, Lán WàngJī said, “Hurry up! Recite the rules. I know that you can recall them.”</p>
        <p>“Aargh..., even though I had recited some rules yesterday, right now, however, I can’t remember them at all.” Wèi WúXiàn replied.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then gave him another a slap. And, this time, Wèi WúXiàn was sure that it was not a pat.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, why are you slapping me?” Wèi WúXiàn’s voice sounded erotic due to the overwhelming pleasure he felt.</p>
        <p>“If I stop slapping you, will you recite the GūsūLán rules?” Lán WàngJī asked.</p>
        <p>“Aaah..., how am I supposed to remember the rules when you are bumping me so hard.” Wèi WúXiàn complained.</p>
        <p>Then, he added,  “How about you recite a few rules to help me remember them?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī’s ears turned red as he realised that it was impossible for him to recite the rules while making love to Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Try to remember them by yourself.” Lán WàngJī thundered, then, he added, “If you don’t recite the rules, you will be punished.”</p>
        <p>Putting his words into action, Lán WàngJī pulled his manhood so to position the head midway out around the open of Wèi WúXiàn’s hole, and was ready to give the punishment.</p>
        <p>Having Lán WàngJī’s huge stuff staying still was more unbearable for Wèi WúXiàn than when he got pounded hard. So, he had no other choices but to try hard to recollect the few rules from yesterday.</p>
        <p>He began, “The Buddhist scriptures teach: ‘You have to be honest and respectful, cautious with your words and deeds, always having a moral conduct’.”</p>
        <p>Unexpectedly, Wèi WúXiàn recited the most elaborate scripture. And, it turned out that he was right about reciting the rules while they were making love, because it came as a blow to Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>He wanted Wèi WúXiàn to recite the rules, however, he could not bear to hear him reciting the scriptures.</p>
        <p>Unaware of the change in Lán WàngJī’s mood, Wèi WúXiàn carried on reciting the scriptures.</p>
        <p>Then, all of a sudden, Lán WàngJī thrust his manhood inside Wèi WúXiàn’s hole.</p>
        <p>“Haaah..., Lán Zhàn!” Wèi WúXiàn cried, “What are you doing?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī calmly said, “Don’t recite the Buddhist scriptures. Just recite the maxims.”</p>
        <p>“Are they both not the GūsūLán rules? I can’t tell which is which.” Wèi WúXiàn argued.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then hit hard on Wèi WúXiàn’s P-spot, “Wèi Yīng, you are not allowed to recite the Buddhist scriptures. You can only recite the maxims. If you don’t, you’re going to be punished, again.”</p>
        <p>“But which ones are maxims?” thought Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Lán WàngJī kept on bumping him hard, causing his head to spin a little bit.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s mind was in a mess, nevertheless, he managed to recollect some rules and recite them, “Killing and stealing are forbidden.”</p>
        <p>Listening to Wèi WúXiàn, Lán WàngJī was on one hand very moved that he had recalled the maxims, and, on the other hand, it got him overexcited that he felt the urge to pound him even harder.</p>
        <p>As he did so, Wèi WúXiàn was no longer in the state of recollecting any maxims.</p>
        <p>“Aaah... Ér Gege, I can’t remember the rest of the rules. Please, have mercy on me. Argh... Don’t hit that place so hard.”</p>
        <p>Noting that Wèi WúXiàn couldn’t any longer remember the maxims, Lán WàngJī, in a coaxing voice, said, “Wèi Yīng, think carefully.”</p>
        <p>“Haaah...,  I will think..., I’m going to think carefully. So, please, stop hitting that spot. I can’t bear this sensation any longer.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī, however, didn’t stop hitting his weak spot, instead he carried on bumping Wèi WúXiàn harder.</p>
        <p>The sound of their love-making filled the whole room.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s hole tightened around Lán WàngJī’s manhood. He was feeling so good that it seemed to him that his bones were getting weaker.</p>
        <p>As a result, it was getting hard for him to keep on supporting his upper body with his elbows, which were resting on the dressing table.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī was now looking at Wèi WúXiàn with his cheeks turned rosy, and his eyes filled with lust. He was completely engulfed in an intense sexual desire, with his mind full of naughty thoughts.</p>
        <p>As no more maxims came into his mind, Wèi WúXiàn eventually gave up, “Lán Zhàn, HánGuāng-Jūn, I don’t recall the rest of the maxims. So, please, don’t bump me so hard.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, if you don’t carry on reciting the rules, you will receive a punishment.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn replied, “I accept the punishment..., old-fashioned boy. You can punish me.”</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī said , “Count every thrust until one hundred.”</p>
        <p>“Why are you so mean! Aaah! Be gentle.” Wèi WúXiàn protested.</p>
        <p>Once more, Lán WàngJī pull his manhood, and, this time, he pulled the whole stuff out and positioned the head on the open of the hole.</p>
        <p>Without warning, he thrust his hot stuff deeply inside Wèi WúXiàn’s hole. Then, he counted, “One.” and added, “Count the rest by yourself.”</p>
        <p>The sudden thrust almost brought tears in Wèi WúXiàn’s eyes. However, since he had accepted to be punished, he could only complied, and began to count, “Two..., three..., four... aaah... five... aargh...”</p>
        <p>Unlike his first thrust, Lán WàngJī’s back and forth movements were more gentle. However, each time he hit the weak spot, it was enough to caused Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body to quiver.</p>
        <p>After each of his thrusts, Lán WàngJī was pausing to allow Wèi WúXiàn to catch his breath, and keep on counting.</p>
        <p>Some white foam was produced by Lán WàngJī’s back and forth movements. As he carried on, his huge stuff alternately moved the foam in and out of Wèi WúXiàn’s hole.</p>
        <p>After counting up to eighty times, Wèi WúXiàn could no longer carry on counting. Furthermore, as his strength failed him, his knees slid off the stool, and his upper body collapsed on the dressing table.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then stopped moving, and, in a gentle voice, he said, “Wèi Yīng, raise your head, and let me see your face in the mirror.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn somehow managed to raise his head. The corners of his eyes worn the trace of tears, and his face was covered with droplets of sweat. He was looking exhausted, and yet, at the same time, enticing.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī chuckled. He then carried Wèi WúXiàn, and made him sit on the dressing table.</p>
        <p>And then, he put Wèi WúXiàn’s arms around his neck, spread Wèi WúXiàn’s legs so to have a full view his hole’s open, and, once more, he penetrated him.</p>
        <p>The inside of Wèi WúXiàn was warm and slippery, and continuously throbbing due to the overwhelming pleasure.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then coaxed him, “Wèi Yīng, it’s only twenty thrusts to go, how about we finish counting them.”</p>
        <p>A brief memory of both of them kneeling in front of the ancestral hall and receiving a punishment crossed Wèi WúXiàn’s mind.</p>
        <p>Somehow, this flashback appeared to him as their first worship*, that they had already formed ties, back then.</p>
        <small>*In Chinese traditional wedding ceremony, newly-weds kowtow three times: to the heavens and earth , to their parents and to each other.</small>
        <p>He also remembered that back then Lán WàngJī used to punish him.</p>
        <p>With his arms weakly wrapped around Lán WàngJī’s neck, Wèi WúXiàn asked while whimpering,“Ér Gege, why you always punish me?”</p>
        <p>This time, Lán WàngJī laughed out loud, his beautiful lips turned into a large smile, and some light shone in his eyes like a sea of stars.</p>
        <p>All of these wonders made Wèi WúXiàn’s heart beat fast.</p>
        <p>Charmed by this unparalleled beauty, Wèi WúXiàn tightened his hug around Lán WàngJī’s neck, then, he said, “Lán Zhàn, you can resume your punishment.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī licked Wèi WúXiàn’s ear, then, he softly kissed it, and then, in his deep voice, he asked, “Will you carry on counting?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, I will.” replied Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī rewarded him with a kiss on his lips.</p>
        <p>Then, with Wèi WúXiàn’s legs resting in the crook of his arms, Lán WàngJī slowly moved back, and then, he thrust with a great strength.</p>
        <p>“Aaah! So ruthless!” cried Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>After only a few times of being bumped hard, Wèi WúXiàn could no longer carry on counting.</p>
        <p>While he was still moving fiercely back and forth, Lán WàngJī asked, “Wèi Yīng, are you still counting? What is the count up to now?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn shook his head left and right while moaning, he slightly pushed Lán WàngJī on the shoulders to make him stop for a moment.</p>
        <p>However, Lán WàngJī ignored his demand, and carried on at the same pace, making Wèi WúXiàn’s whole body quiver with pleasure.</p>
        <p>“Darling, I can’t keep up! Please, have mercy on me.” Wèi WúXiàn was crying so beautifully that his appearance invoked the image of a pear blossom under the droplets of the rain.</p>
        <p>He was also shaking his head and scratching Lán WàngJī’s shoulders.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, I will stop when you finish counting.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Somehow, Wèi WúXiàn managed to ask, “Eighty eight?”</p>
        <p>While he was enjoying the view of Wèi WúXiàn trembling under the overwhelming pleasure that he gave, Lán WàngJī nodded. Then, he softened his thrusts.</p>
        <p>“Eighty nine..., ninety...” Wèi WúXiàn resumed counting.</p>
        <p>Since Wèi WúXiàn was back on track, Lán WàngJī brought Wèi WúXiàn’s legs more closer together, then, he began to pound hard, once again, causing Wèi WúXiàn’s voice to sound shaky.</p>
        <p>“Ninety five..., aaah...,” Between his moans, Wèi WúXiàn tried hard to keep on counting.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī smiled.</p>
        <p>Then, he poured a shower of light kisses on his crying face. However, he didn’t show mercy while he kept on moving his lower body.</p>
        <p>He said between his kisses, “You got the count wrong. Receive your punishment.”</p>
        <p>And then, he kindly corrected him, “It’s ninety one.”</p>
        <p>Having no other options, Wèi WúXiàn carried on, “Ninety two...”</p>
        <p>Then, Lán WàngJī made a much more powerful thrust, causing Wèi WúXiàn to shoot out a jet of the white fluid.</p>
        <p>Being thrown in dazing state, Wèi WúXiàn moaned, and uttered, “Argh..., ninety seven...”</p>
        <p>Extremely pleased with the desired outcome, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you got the count wrong, again. Start over.”</p>
        <p>“What?!”Wèi WúXiàn thought that he had heard it wrong.</p>
        <p>“I said you made a mistake in counting. Restart from the beginning.” Lán WàngJī replied with a smile on his face.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn shook his head so frenetically that his long hair spread over his shoulders. There were only few counting left to reach one hundred.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, you did it on purpose.” protested Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Yes, I did it on purpose.” admitted Lán WàngJī, “I was teasing you.”</p>
        <p>Then, he gave Wèi WúXiàn another shower of kisses, filled with tenderness, all over his face.</p>
        <p>As he kissed him, Wèi WúXiàn felt Lán WàngJī’s warm breath caressing his face. This display of love warmed his heart.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then said, “Wèi Yīng, it’s you who said that I can do whatever I want.”</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn truly loves me.” thought Wèi WúXiàn, “And, he looks so happy.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn could not help but spread out his trembling legs a bit more. As he did so, the liquid produced inside his hole slid down between his buttocks.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī was pleased by Wèi WúXiàn’s invitation. He then asked in gentle voice, “Wèi Yīng, can you carry on counting?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn slightly shook his head as a reply, his fair-skinned and beautiful face wore the trace of tears.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn is going to punish me, again.” said Wèi WúXiàn inwardly, “Whatever he wants me to do I will do it.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then took off Wèi WúXiàn’s forehead ribbon, then, he tied Wèi WúXiàn’s mouth as to prevent him from speaking or making a sound.</p>
        <p>He wrapped the white ribbon three times around Wèi WúXiàn’s slightly open mouth. The forehead ribbon was quickly soaked around his mouth.</p>
        <p>With his hands on Lán WàngJī’s shoulders, Wèi WúXiàn wanted to pushed him away, and yet, he welcomed him, instead. However, in his gleamed eyes, one could read his pleading.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn wanted to say, “Be gentle, Ér Gege. You can do whatever you want, but, please, be gentle.” However, his mouth was sealed.</p>
        <p>In one hand, Lán WàngJī held Wèi WúXiàn’s manhood, then, using his thumb, he blocked the small open.</p>
        <p>With a smile that didn’t convey any mercy, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, bite the ribbon tight, I’m going to begin bullying you.”</p>
    </div>

        <br />
        <p>“Ér Gege, my forehead ribbon got too soaked to be worn.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“It’s okay. I’ll give you another ribbon.” Lán WàngJī replied.</p>
        <p>“It looked that you were pleased because I was wearing a forehead ribbon.” Wèi WúXiàn remarked, “Do you like to see me wearing a ribbon? If that is the case, then, from now on, I’ll be wearing one.”</p>
        <p>He then added, “However, the inconvenience of wearing a forehead ribbon is that it’s easily got crooked.”</p>
        <p>“You don’t have to.” Lán WàngJī said, “If it is awkward for you, then, don’t wear it.”</p>
        <p>Then, he reassured him, “Wèi Yīng, with me by your side, just act like you always do. You don’t need to discipline yourself to behave differently.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled at him.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī was washing Wèi WúXiàn, and, when he was done, he carried him to the bed.</p>
        <p>After putting Wèi WúXiàn under the duvet, Lán WàngJī kissed his forehead, then left the room to go and find his brother and the doctor.</p>
        <p>Since, today, he had slept a lot, Wèi WúXiàn woke up soon after. And, while quietly complaining about Lán WàngJī not behaving like an upright member of GūsūLán, earlier, Wèi WúXiàn was making his exploration of the room.</p>
        <p>He aimlessly inspected every corner of Jingshi, rummaged through all the furniture of the room until he found a small hidden trapdoor on the floor, the inside was of the size of a large drawer.</p>
        <p>The first thing Wèi WúXiàn saw was a few clay jars of ‘Emperor Smile’*</p>
        <small>*Emperor Smile is the name of the wine made in Gūsū region, and Wèi WúXiàn’s favourite wine.</small>
        <p>With a smile, Wèi WúXiàn uttered, “It’s not so bad to have an indecent Lán Zhàn.”</p>
        <p>He took out one of the jars, and when he was about to drink it, he noticed a dimmed blue light beneath the clay jars. He removed all the jars, and revealed a box that was sealed with a weak spiritual power.</p>
        <p>To open the box required the one who put the seal. Wèi WúXiàn thought, “Since I am also the host of Jingshi, I can open this box.”</p>
        <p>So, he poured a small amount of his spiritual power on the sealed box, and, as he was expected, the seal was broken.</p>
        <p>The wooden box was exquisitely crafted, with two hibiscus flowers engraved on top, so beautifully carved that the flowers looked like they were real.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn opened the box, and took out a booklet that was titled ‘Mountain of Joy and Grief’. He glanced through it, and was dumbfounded. Then, he sighed, “Lán Zhàn has become really indecent.”</p>
        <p>Something else inside the exquisite box attracted his attention; it was some rolled papers. Wèi WúXiàn took out the papers carefully, then unrolled them.</p>
        <p>He earnestly looked at the contents, and then, he said, “Lán Zhàn actually painted me...”</p>
        <p>The first painting was in the ‘cold spring’ of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù. In that painting, Wèi WúXiàn was sitting by the spring, wearing only a bathrobe that was already wet, revealing his enticing body shape.</p>
        <p>His beautiful face was faintly visible, he had one leg raised as though he was about to splash the cold water onto someone. The painting was candid with warm tones, and, at the same time, arousing.</p>
        <p>The second painting was in Jingshi. Wèi WúXiàn was sitting in front of the mirror of the dressing table, his upper body was naked, his long hair was tied up into a ponytail, revealing his slender and graceful neck, as well as his slim and toned back.</p>
        <p>His face was slightly turned towards the back, and his eyes gleamed ambiguously with a seducing smile on the corner of his lips.</p>
        <p>The third one was also in Jingshi, Wèi WúXiàn was sleeping in bed, with the duvet only covering his body up to the waist, revealing here and there the love bites on his bare skin.</p>
        <p>The love bites were from the neck down to the belly button, and seemed to form a pattern that was done on purpose.</p>
        <p>In that painting, Wèi WúXiàn appeared to sleep soundly, with the forehead ribbon wrapped around his wrists.</p>
        <p>The painting seemed to have being painted in the morning, showing where Lán WàngJī was sleeping.</p>
        <p>Being moved by the splendid view of his sleeping Wèi Yīng, Lán WàngJī could not resist to capture that moment into a painting.</p>
        <p>As Wèi WúXiàn kept on looking at them, one by one, he noticed that the paintings were getting more and more daring, which made his cheeks turn pink.</p>
        <p>Then, he saw a painting that appeared to have being painted by him. In that painting, Wèi WúXiàn had painted Lán WàngJī. And, when the latter returned, he found him sitting at the table with the wooden box placed on the table.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s face wore a solemn expression, and he was staring fixedly at Lán WàngJī. Then, with a resolved tone, he said, “Lán Zhàn, take off your clothes.”</p>
        <p>Besides the box, there were also two paintings, placed side by side, in front of Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>One of the two paintings depicted Lán WàngJī, with a majestic expression on his face, lying on one side with one elbow supporting his upper body.</p>
        <p>He had one leg bent, the foot lay flat on the bed, and his other arm limply rested on his knee. In that painting, Lán WàngJī appeared to look straight at the one who was painting him.</p>
        <p>This posture revealed one rounded scar on his chest and a few string-like scars on his shoulder, since he was only wearing a pair of trousers.</p>
        <p>In the other painting, Lán WàngJī’s upper body was also bare, and, since he was giving his back to the painter, the thirty three gruesome scars left by the GūsūLán’s whip were all exposed.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was now tapping his fingers on the table, indicating his impatience. As for Lán WàngJī, he was looking at the two paintings, then, at Wèi WúXiàn’s fingers, then back again at the paintings.</p>
        <p>Being already aware that Wèi WúXiàn had seen all their paintings, Lán WàngJī then looked at him affectionately.</p>
        <p>This display of love almost swept away Wèi WúXiàn’s irritation. He then quickly regained control of himself, stood up all of a sudden, and thundered, “What are you waiting for? Remove your clothes!”</p>
        <p>Then, unable to wait any longer, he quickly walked towards Lán WàngJī, and began frenetically to untie Lán WàngJī’s waist belt.</p>
        <p>As he did so, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Are you planning on making love to me with your clothes on, for the rest of our lives, if I don’t regain my memories?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī let Wèi WúXiàn remove the waist belt. Then, he held Wèi WúXiàn’s hands, tenderly patted them, and then, he began to take off his clothes himself.</p>
        <p>In a low voice, he called, “Wèi Yīng.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn raised his head to towards him, and saw that Lán WàngJī’s eyes were expressing a deep sadness.</p>
        <p>After removing all his top clothes, Lán WàngJī hugged Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Unlike his usual cold expression, Lán WàngJī’s skin was warm, and made Wèi WúXiàn feel relaxed and comfortable. Wèi WúXiàn then rested his head on Lán WàngJī’s chest, listening to his heartbeat.</p>
        <p>Then, he turned his head to face the burned mark* on Lán WàngJī’s chest, and then, he tenderly kissed it.</p>
        <small>*The mark depicted the hot branding iron of Wēn sect, which Lán WàngJī found while he was drunk, and inflicted it to himself, (He drank because of his grief at Wèi WúXiàn’s death).</small>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn.” Wèi WúXiàn asked in a hoarse voice, “Does this mark have something to do with me?”</p>
        <p>Intuitively, Wèi WúXiàn knew that all those scars on Lán WàngJī’s body were related to him.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Then, he asked another question, “Lán Zhàn, my past, or rather our past, was it painful?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “Yes, it was painful.”</p>
        <p>In Caiyin Town, Wèi WúXiàn had already become aware of people’s hostility towards me.</p>
        <p>“It seems that I have been living with Lán Zhàn as a couple for many years. By now, those people should have changed their attitude towards him for the sake of Lán Zhàn and GūsūLán sect.</p>
        <p>“Unless, I have done something else more terrible than what happened during the Shooting Sun campaign.” thought Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>He then asked again, “Was it extremely painful?”</p>
        <p>In a low voice, Lán WàngJī replied, “Yes, it was extremely painful.”</p>
        <p>“Oh.” uttered Wèi WúXiàn, then, he gently fondled the rounded scar on Lán WàngJī’s chest, and then, he said, “Let me see your back.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī turned around slowly. His whole back was covered with the criss-cross scars, which were spread across his shoulders and the back of his arms.</p>
        <p>Some scars were shallow while others were deep and hideous, making a strong contrast to Lán WàngJī’s white and smooth skin, and ruining his back that once could be considered as a perfect male back.</p>
        <p>After looking at Lán WàngJī’s scars, Wèi WúXiàn was still unable to recall how Lán WàngJī got them. However, he could not understand why he felt so sad all of a sudden.</p>
        <p>Then, he recalled asking Jiāng YànLí* why people fall in love, why one would like to put the noose around the neck.</p>
        <small>*Jiāng YànLí is Jiāng Chéng’s elder sister, Jīn Líng’s mother and Wèi WúXiàn’s shījiě (female senior in any kind of disciplines, i.e martial arts in this case).</small>
        <p>“So, that’s how it feels to have the noose around your neck; you also feel the pain of the one you love.” said Wèi WúXiàn inwardly.</p>
        <p>As though he had read Wèi WúXiàn’s mind, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, it’s all over now.”</p>
        <p>“Oh.” said Wèi WúXiàn in a low voice.</p>
        <p>Then, unable to prevent his hand from shaking as he brought it close to Lán WàngJī’s back, Wèi WúXiàn began slowly to slide his trembling fingers on the criss-cross scars.</p>
        <p>And then, with his forehead pressed on Lán WàngJī’s back, Wèi WúXiàn hugged him tight.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng?” Lán WàngJī called him.</p>
        <p>Then, since Wèi WúXiàn didn’t reply, he called him again.</p>
        <p>“Why are you calling me?” Wèi WúXiàn finally replied, then, he added, “I’m not crying.”</p>
        <p>“Oh! Okay, then.” said Lán WàngJī, “You are really brave. Well done!”</p>
        <p>“Are you consoling a child?” remarked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, do you remember what you said back then when we were in Xuanwu Cave*: ‘It’s not a big deal for a man to have injuries that leave scars’.”</p>
        <small>*Under the domination of Wēn sect, Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn found themselves trapped in that cave.</small>
        <p>Sceptical, Wèi WúXiàn asked. “Did I say that?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, you did.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Then, he added, “You also said: ‘Even though this injury will leave a scar, however, that will always indicate how brave I was in protecting a girl. And also, that girl will never forget me for the rest of her life’.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then turned around to face Wèi WúXiàn, and, once more, he embraced him.</p>
        <p>As a result of what Lán WàngJī had just said, Wèi WúXiàn pinched him and bit him on the chest, out of displeasure.</p>
        <p>He then asked, “Are you comforting me, or taking this opportunity to vent your still-not-forget jealousy?”</p>
        <p>Then, he exclaimed, “Wait a minute! Are you implying that I am like a girl in need of protection?”</p>
        <p>“I’m not.” denied Lán WàngJī, “I am truly comforting you, as well as, venting my jealousy.”</p>
        <p>He then added, “You said that you like it when I am jealous, that I can be jealous as many times as I want.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn laughed and said, “How could I possibly say such a thing?”</p>
        <p>“And yet, you did say it, last year.” affirmed Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>He then said, “Wèi Yīng, many unpleasant things had happened in the past. However, since you came back, everything has been fine.”</p>
        <p>As he remember what Jiāng Chéng told him earlier, Wèi WúXiàn asked in a low voice, “Ever since I came back, have you always been by my side?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“No wonder everything has been all right.” remarked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>

        <br />
        <p>Like in quiet meditation, Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn hugged each other in complete silence.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn wandered his fingers on Lán WàngJī’s bare skin continuously. As he did so, he felt the body temperature of Lán WàngJī entering his own body through his fingers, and making his heart fill with joy.</p>
        <p>He suddenly gained self-confidence, and said, “Earlier, while I was waiting for you, I was also thinking of a way that will help me regain my memories.</p>
        <p>“Since I have now a golden core, and if I can remember some fragment of my lost memories, I can use that fragment as an anchor to penetrate into the realm of my unconscious mind.</p>
        <p>“Once I enter, with the support of my golden core, I will be able to gather other fragments of my memories, which reside in the unconscious mind.</p>
        <p>“Since memories are connected to each other, the more I recollect things the faster I will recover all my memories.”</p>
        <p>“Have you thought it through?” Lán WàngJī asked.</p>
        <p>“To be honest, I haven’t completely thought it over.” Wèi WúXiàn replied, “And, I still need to prepare myself first. Nonetheless, I have to face what had happened in the past.”</p>
        <p>He carried on after a short pause, “This morning, you helped me again strengthen my golden core via the dual cultivation. I have now begun to feel the result.</p>
        <p>“For instance, about your scars, although I didn’t recall anything, however, I was able to sense something. Still, it will take long for my golden core to become more powerful.</p>
        <p>“So, rather than waiting for my memories to return suddenly, or maybe they will return only partially, I prefer to use a method that will help me to recover them gradually.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “If you want some help in recalling any fragment of your memories, you can ask me whatever you want to know.”</p>
        <p>“I want to know about the rules of this room.” Wèi WúXiàn said, “I also found among other things  inside that box a scroll, in which Jingshi’s rules are written.</p>
        <p>“There is a rule that I specifically want to know. It’s written in red as follows: ‘You are not allowed to use that technique on Wèi Yīng’.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then slowly slid his hands from Wèi WúXiàn’s back down to his waist, and, without warning, he released his spiritual power through his fingers while he was stroking Wèi WúXiàn’s waist.</p>
        <p>And, at the same time, he asked innocently, “Which technique are you talking about?”</p>
        <p>“Argh...” Wèi WúXiàn could not help but let out a long moan, which was caused by the sudden sensation felt around his waist.</p>
        <p>Then, he began to struggle in an attempt to set himself free from Lán WàngJī’s arms. However, in spite of his effort, he was unable to succeed, because Lán WàngJī held him tight, and didn’t want to let him go.</p>
        <p>Furious, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, you went too far! I can’t believe it!”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then laughed. It seemed as though the room became suddenly more brighter because of his laughter.</p>
        <p>He lowered his head, and covered Wèi WúXiàn’s lips in a deep kiss, sweeping away his anger, inserting his tongue deeply inside his mouth, and sucking all his breath.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s anxiety over the past events finally settled down by Lán WàngJī’s kiss.</p>
        <p>He could not remember how gruesome and painful their past was. However, he knew that sooner or later he had to face it.</p>
        <p>Besides, the past events were a fait accompli. Whether he recalled them or not, they had already occurred, and there was nothing he could do to reverse or modify the outcome.</p>
        <p>However, now that Lán WàngJī was by his side, holding him tight, and kissing him with passion, Wèi WúXiàn could tell that the present time was more cheerful.</p>
        <p>After a long kiss, Lán WàngJī finally let go of his mouth, then, brought his own lips close to Wèi WúXiàn’s ear, he said, “I want you to come with me to see someone.”</p>
        <p>Then, he took Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, and led him out of Jingshi.</p>
        <p>Once outside, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Lán Zhàn, do we usually hold hands while walking at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù?”</p>
        <p>“Occasionally.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “That’s right. Two grown-up men holding hands is a little bit weird.”</p>
        <p>Then, despite what he just said, Wèi WúXiàn tightened his grip on Lán WàngJī’s hand.</p>
        <p>Along the way, GūsūLán disciples were acting as usual, calm and undisturbed by the view of these two.</p>
        <p>“What if your uncle sees us?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “We try as much as possible not to let him see us like this.” Then, he added, “Nevertheless, it doesn’t matter if he sees us.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn felt warm inside by Lán WàngJī’s last words. Still, he thought that they should not let the uncle see them like this too often.</p>
        <p>Then, he asked, “Lán Zhàn, who is that person you want me to see?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī only said, “Two days ago, I sent her an invitation letter to come to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù. However, it turned out that she is physically unfit to travel. Still, she managed to arrive here today.”</p>
        <p>“Physically unfit to travel! Is that person very old?” Wèi WúXiàn asked.</p>
        <p>“Do you want to know?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, I do.”</p>
        <p>“I won’t tell you.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <br />
        <p>... ... ...</p>
        <br />
        <p>As they stepped into the front yard of the Elegant Room, they saw a cute little girl pacing up and down in front of the entrance.</p>
        <p>She was dressed in light crimson, wearing long braided hair, and had lovely eyes of purple grapes colour.</p>
        <p>At the moment she saw Wèi WúXiàn, the little girl’s eyes lit up, then, she began to run towards him.</p>
        <p>Her father chased after her, and, in low voice, he scolded her, “Mián-Mián, at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù, you are not allowed to run.”</p>
        <p>Then, Lín Ruì, Mián-Mián’s father, greeted them, “HánGuāng-Jūn and Mr Wèi.”</p>
        <p>“HánGuāng-Jūn.” Mián-Mián also greeted.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn returned the greeting to Lín Ruì, while wandering why the little girl ignored him.</p>
        <p>Lín Ruì said to his daughter, “Mián-Mián, didn’t you see that Mr Wèi is also here?”</p>
        <p>Then, the little girl was forced to greet Wèi WúXiàn, “Uncle Wèi.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was a little bit disappointed; why the little girl used ‘uncle’ instead of ‘big brother’ to greet him.</p>
        <p>Mián-Mián then said to him, “Come on, my mum is inside and waiting for you.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn got puzzled, he glanced at Lán WàngJī, and the latter nodded his head, letting him know that he had to go in and find out by himself.</p>
        <p>When Wèi WúXiàn entered the Elegant Room, he saw a pregnant woman.</p>
        <p>The belly of Luó QīngYáng*, Mián-Mián’s mother, was round and big, looking like a huge balloon.</p>
        <small>*Luó QīngYáng is the girl whom Wèi WúXiàn protected in Xuanwu Cave.</small>
        <p>Luó QīngYáng stood up as soon as she saw them, and, with a smile, she greeted them, “HánGuāng-Jūn and Wèi-gōngzǐ.”</p>
        <p>She carried on, “Wèi-gōngzǐ, I heard that you have temporarily lost your memories. Have you also forgotten about us?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn turned his head towards Lán WàngJī for help, then he noticed that the little girl was staring at him.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, it came back to him, “Mián-Mián!” he exclaimed, “You are Mián-Mián?!”</p>
        <p>Overexcited, Wèi WúXiàn said, “So, now there are two Mián-Mián: a grown-up and a little Mián-Mián.”</p>
        <p>Luó QīngYáng smiled, then replied, “That’s right. Mián-Mián is my nickname, and my name Qīngyáng. You should also memorise my name.”</p>
        <p>“Your name is QīngYáng.*” uttered Wèi WúXiàn, “No wonder, back then, your friends called you Mián-Mián.”</p>
        <small>*The character of Yáng in QīngYáng is the same as in the characters for sheep (Miányáng), therefore, her friends nickname her Mián-Mián.</small>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn looked at her belly, and asked, “Which month of  pregnancy are you now?”</p>
        <p>“I am eight months pregnant, and about to give birth to my second child.” replied Luó QīngYáng.</p>
        <p>Mián-Mián said, “It’s my little brother.”</p>
        <p>“Do you prefer a little brother or a little sister?” Wèi WúXiàn asked Mián-Mián.</p>
        <p>Mián-Mián replied, “I prefer both. But this one is the little brother, and he has already a name.”</p>
        <p>“Oh? What is his name?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“His name is YuǎnDào, meaning ‘Mián-Mián longs for a long way’”, Lín Ruì replied, “Mián-Mián always wanted to have brothers and sisters to play with her.”</p>
        <p>He carried on, “Speaking of the name, Wèi-gōngzǐ, this name can be considered to be chosen by you.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn thought for a while, then remembered saying that his name was YuǎnDào to Mián-Mián, back then. He then exclaimed, “How dare you take it seriously?”</p>
        <p>Lín Ruì said, “Back when you were teenagers, you have saved QīngYáng’s life, so it’s natural to be the one choosing the name for our child.”</p>
        <p>“It was HánGuāng-Jūn who saved her, not me.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“It’s all the same.” insisted Lín Ruì.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked Mián-Mián, “Are you longing to have little brothers and sisters? Will you help out taking care of them? Do you know how to look after babies?”</p>
        <p>“Of course, I do.” replied Mián-Mián, and gently hugged her mother’s belly, “All the babies do is eat and sleep.”</p>
        <p>“How can it be so easy?” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Mián-Mián asked, “Do you mean that you have already taken care of a baby?”</p>
        <p>“Of course, I have.” replied Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Then, with his hands, he showed how small Little Apple* was, and said, “I have taken care of a little baby girl of this size. She looks exactly like you when you were a baby.”</p>
        <small>*Little Apple is the name Wèi WúXiàn gives to the baby he saved.</small>
        <p>Luó QīngYáng chuckled, “Wèi-gōngzǐ, here you go again. How could you possibly know how Mián-Mián looked like when she was a baby?”</p>
        <p>She then asked Lán WàngJī, “HánGuāng-Jūn, has Wèi-gōngzǐ really taken care of a baby?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, he has.” replied Lán WàngJī, then told them the whole story of Little Apple, and afterwards, he sent someone to bring over the baby.</p>
        <p>Deeply moved, Lín Ruì said, “Wèi-gōngzǐ is as always valiant.”</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, Mián-Mián happily said, “Mum, he just moved.”</p>
        <p>“Your little brother is much more lively now because it’s the eight months of pregnancy.” said Luó QīngYáng to her daughter, “You were also like this.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then became very curious about Luó QīngYáng’s pregnancy. After a while, however, he felt embarrassed by his staring at her belly.</p>
        <p>Lín Ruì asked, “Second* Lady Lán, don’t you want to feel the foetal movement?”</p>
        <small>*Lín Ruì calls Wèi WúXiàn ‘Second Lady’ because Lán wangji, his husband, is the second son.</small>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was startled. He thought that the title of ‘Lady’ was a little bit weird for him. At the same time, he felt that it made sense, and could not find another suitable title.</p>
        <p>Yes, indeed, he really wanted to feel Lín YuǎnDào’s activity.</p>
        <p>He said inwardly, “Since I am the Second Lady Lán, then I should act like one. Therefore, there is no harm in feeling the foetal movement.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then put his hand on Luó QīngYáng’s belly, and waited for a while. And then, he said, “The little Lín YuǎnDào fell asleep.”</p>
        <p>Then, all of a sudden, he sensed at last two baby kicks. The baby’s movement seemed like a touch of a feather gently tickling his palm.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn thought, “A tiny life is forming. It’s so sacred and wonderful.”</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <br />
        <p>Amazed by the foetal activity, Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “He kicked me!”</p>
        <p>“Just like I said before, he is moving.” Mián-Mián proudly said.</p>
        <p>Luó QīngYáng smiled, and said, “Right now, you better stay in my belly, and be good.” then, she carried on, “Every day, he is wiggling all day along. I will be busy after giving birth to him.”</p>
        <p>At that precise moment, Lán SīZhuī entered the room holding Little Apple, who was sleeping. Lán JǐngYí followed behind, and seemed like he didn’t dare to hold such a tiny baby.</p>
        <p>Mián-Mián got excited when she saw the baby, however, she didn’t dare to draw near her.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn laughed at her, “You see, it’s not that easy to take care of a baby. You don’t even dare to come closer. What you need is to learn little by little.”</p>
        <p>Mián-Mián was not yet convinced, she said, “Uncle Wèi, I don’t think that you know how to look after a baby.”</p>
        <p>“I just want to know,” said Wèi WúXiàn, “why are you calling ‘uncle’?</p>
        <p>“Right now, I am lacking twenty years of memories, which are equivalent to twenty years ago, which, in turn, means I am twenty years old younger.</p>
        <p>“So, for now, call me Gēge* until I recover my memories, then, at that time, you can call me ‘uncle’.”</p>
        <small>*Gēge means elder brother.</small>
        <p>“Anyone who knows how to look after a baby should be called ‘uncle’.” replied Mián-Mián, “Didn’t you say that you have taken care of this baby?”</p>
        <p>Luó QīngYáng laughed, then said, “Wèi-gōngzǐ, according to HánGuāng-Jūn’s account, you had taken care of her at most half a day.</p>
        <p>“How about my husband and I give both of you some tips on how to look after a baby?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn replied, “All right. It’s good to have many skills.”</p>
        <p>Luó QīngYáng then held Little Apple in her arms, and began her guidance.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī listened attentively, and memorised everything that had been said.</p>
        <br />
        <p>… … …</p>
        <br />
        <p>After having dinner together, some of the disciples escorted Luó QīngYáng and Mián-Mián to the guest house.</p>
        <p>Lín Ruì, who stayed behind, said to Wèi WúXiàn, “Wèi-gōngzǐ, there are things that QīngYáng thinks are not essential in telling you. As for me, I’m not good at talking.”</p>
        <p>Lín Ruì became a little bit shy, and his face turned slightly red, he carried on, “Wèi-gōngzǐ, right now, I’m really happy. I have a good wife, an adorable daughter and, soon, I’ll have a son. My happiness is due to your bravery in saving QīngYáng.</p>
        <p>“You have done a lot of good deeds. You are really a wonderful person. I’m so grateful to you for what you have done for QīngYáng.”</p>
        <br />
        <p>… … …</p>
        <br />
        <p>On their way back to Jingshi, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Did you invite them in the hope that I would remember some past events?”</p>
        <p>“Yes and no.” replied Lán WàngJī, “I sent the invitation letter when I found out that you have lost your memories.</p>
        <p>“However, they had set off as soon as they heard that you have been found. In other words, they were on their way here when I sent the letter.”</p>
        <p>Then, he added, “Wèi Yīng, Mrs Lín and her family do really care about you.”</p>
        <p>When they arrived, they saw Lán SīZhuī, holding Little Apple, waiting at the porch.</p>
        <p>“Each time we brought Little Apple, she’s always asleep.” said Lán SīZhuī, “Now that she is awake, I brought her so you can see her.</p>
        <p>“She has been sleeping a lot these days, it’s around this time that she wakes up.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was extremely happy to see Little Apple awake. He took her and cradled her in his arms the way Luó QīngYáng taught them, earlier.</p>
        <p>He slid one hand under the baby’s head, and the other under her bottom, then, he lifted the baby.</p>
        <p>Next step, he nestled the baby’s head in the crook of his arm, cupping the baby’s bottom with the other hand, then, he held her close.</p>
        <p>Little Apple then began to wave her little hands in the air, and patted Wèi WúXiàn’s face in process. She seemed to like Wèi WúXiàn’s smooth skin, and started to pinch his face.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn slightly cried out, “Aah! You are just a tiny little thing, why are you so strong?”</p>
        <p>Lán SīZhuī had a rattle hanging on his waist belt. He took it off, and began to shake the toy to play with the baby.</p>
        <p>Immediately, Little Apple spread her arms, wanting Lán SīZhuī to hold her.</p>
        <p>Lán SīZhuī then handed the toy to Wèi WúXiàn, however, Little Apple still wanted him to hold her.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn passed over the rattle to Lán WàngJī, who, at once, started to shake gently in the front of the baby.</p>
        <p>Little Apple then stopped making fuss, and let Wèi WúXiàn hold her.</p>
        <p>After playing for a while, Little Apple became sleepy. After all, she was only three months old,. So, Lán SīZhuī took her to bring her back to the convent.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn saw him off at the gate of their front garden. Then, all of a sudden, Lán SīZhuī turned around and called, “Xiàn-gēge*.”</p>
        <small>*Xiàn is taken from WúXiàn, and also Lán SīZhuī used to call Wèi WúXiàn ‘Xiàn-gēge’ when he was a kid.</small>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn got puzzled. When he chatted with Lán SīZhuī, the latter had kept calling him ‘Wèi-qiánbèi’. Why did he change the way he was calling him?</p>
        <p>Lán SīZhuī explained himself, “I called you ‘Xiàn-gēge’ because I heard you saying to Mián-Mián that you wanted to be called ‘Gēge’.”</p>
        <p>“You are indeed a smart kid and well mannered.” Wèi WúXiàn praised him.</p>
        <p>Unexpectedly, Lán SīZhuī didn’t want to show any modesty, instead he happily nodded his head and agreed, “Certainly.”</p>
        <p>He then said, “I am very diligent in doing my homework, and pay great attention during the Night Hunting. I also remember everything that Lán Lǎo, HánGuāng-Jūn and you taught me.</p>
        <p>“I often get high grades, and have recently started to lead my juniors when we go for Night Hunting.”</p>
        <p>Having boastfully said that much about himself, Lán SīZhuī’s face turned slightly red in embarrassment, “I..., I grew up well.”</p>
        <p>With a smile on his face, Wèi WúXiàn said, “I know that you are a good kid.”</p>
        <p>“Xiàn-gēge, I am A-Yuan.” As he said that, Lán SīZhuī’s eyes began to turn red, like someone who was holding back his tears.</p>
        <p>Then, as a joke, he added, “It’s too bad that I can’t cling* onto your leg, since I’m holding Little Apple.”</p>
        <small>*Lán SīZhuī (little A-Yuan), as a kid, used to hang on tight to Wèi WúXiàn’s leg like a little monkey.</small>
        <p>After seeing off Lán SīZhuī, Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn went to the backyard, and sat side by side under the magnolia tree.</p>
        <p>While slowly drinking Emperor’s Smile, Wèi WúXiàn held Lán WàngJī’s arm, and leaned his head against his shoulder.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, many good things had indeed happened.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>In a warm tone, Lán WàngJī agreed, “Yes.”</p>
        <p>While gently rubbing his head on Lán WàngJī’s shoulder, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, do you know all the history books of the GūsūLán library? Are their contents accurate?</p>
        <p>“Because, I’m planning on using the history as an anchor.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “The contents of the history books are not adequate to be used as an anchor.</p>
        <p>“We have an incense burner in our room that helps you enter into a dream. Now, we can even decide on which dream we want to enter.</p>
        <p>“So, if you enter into my dream, and use the events in my dream as an anchor, you should be able to recall all your lost memories.”</p>
        <p>“You don’t need to that.” quickly uttered Wèi WúXiàn. He didn’t want Lán WàngJī to experience again the bad memories.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī earnestly said, “Wèi Yīng, I want to be by your side when you enter into a dream. Let me be by your side to assist you.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn stared open-mouthed at Lán WàngJī, he was deeply moved by his eagerness.</p>
        <p>As he kept on looking at him, Wèi WúXiàn became dazzled by Lán WàngJī’s eyes gleaming like starry sky.</p>
        <p>He then helplessly covered his face with his hands, then, he looked at Lán WàngJī and said, “Lán Zhàn, when we discuss serious matter, you should not look at me like that. Otherwise, I won’t be able to resist.”</p>
        <p>“Okay.” replied Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Then, a warm smile appeared on his face, which at once melted Wèi WúXiàn’s heart. Irresistibly, Wèi WúXiàn smiled back at him.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, they looked up to the sky, admiring the bright and beautiful full moon, which looked like a white jade disc. Here and there, the sky was covered with stars.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then felt his mind had been cleared up. He put down the jar of wine, and, gracefully, climbed the magnolia tree.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī stood up and looked up at him. The moonlight was showering on him, forming a halo around his body. He then approached close to the tree, and spread his arms towards Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Standing on the treetop and looking all smiles, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, I’m ready.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “Okay.”</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, I don’t want to forget why you got injured because of me.” Wèi WúXiàn said, “Also, I want to remember all the good things that happened after I came back.”</p>
        <p>“All right.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>“Will you assist me?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>In a determined way, Lán WàngJī replied, “I will be by your side when you recall all the past events.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn laughed heartily, then, he threw himself into Lán WàngJī’s open arms.</p>

        <br />
        <p>“Uncle, later on, when we’re going see Wèi WúXiàn, have a more nicer attitude.” implored Jīn Líng.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng replied, “I always have a good attitude.”</p>
        <p>“What I mean is he almost died.” Jīn Líng said, “If he had died, he might not come back again.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng gave him a slap in the back of the head, and said, “Stop talking nonsense.” </p>
        <p>Jīn Líng angrily said, “Don’t hit me in the head.”</p>
        <p>There were rumours that were spreading all over Yúnmèng, and it was not conceivable that only a few villagers had given rise to such rumours.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng had assigned his people to trace the source of the rumours. However, every clue they had led nowhere.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng and Jīn Líng were on their way to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù to see Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>And, for the last two days, Jiāng Chéng didn’t pay any visit to Wèi WúXiàn, and was still unwilling to be alone with Lán WàngJī due to their last embarrassing conversation.</p>
        <p>So, he set off on the third day, the last day for the golden core to be reconstructed, since he didn’t have other options than to go there in person.</p>
        <p>However, on their arrival, they learned that Lán XīChén was not around, and no one could inform them about Wèi WúXiàn’s condition.</p>
        <p>Since Jīn Líng had frequently come around, he was familiar with their surroundings, and led the way to Jingshi.</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng’s words ‘he almost died’ echoed again in Jiāng Chéng’s head, and he seemed to be shaken. However, before he could deeply think about it, they had already reached the gate of Jingshi front garden.</p>
        <p>From where they were standing, they could hear some faint sound of guqin coming from the backyard, which indicated that someone was at home.</p>
        <p>A gentle breeze carried some petals of magnolia in the air, like a flake of snow slowly falling from the sky, while being blown left or right depending on the direction of the wind.</p>
        <p>One petal landed on Jīn Líng’s head, and his uncle, who was still shaken by what Jīn Líng had said, brushed away the magnolia petal.</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng, unaware of the petal on his head, glared at his uncle, “What is wrong with you this time.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng also glared at him, “Little brat, what didn’t mean earlier by ‘If he had died’?”</p>
        <p>Then, he thought, “What if Wèi WúXiàn wouldn’t come back again, if he had died...”</p>
        <p>Last time, when Wèi WúXiàn died, Jiāng Chéng was, for thirteen years, consumed by the feelings of anger and hatred.</p>
        <p>He wanted him to come back to explain himself, to kneel down and admit his mistakes, to hear him say ‘I am sorry’. All these kinds of emotions had been tormenting him for thirteen years.</p>
        <p>“If he had died...” Jiāng Chéng thought again, “Jīn Líng is right. Wèi WúXiàn is so reckless. He doesn’t think about the consequences of his action. What if...”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng stared at their door, and, irritably, he carried on thinking, “He lost his golden core in Yúnmèng territory.</p>
        <p>“If it is completely shattered and cannot be repaired, then, the one to be blamed for the loss will be me?</p>
        <p>“Why every time he lost his golden core has something to do with me? Why?”</p>
        <p>Becoming restless, Jīn Líng was impatient to know if they had made any progress, since today was the last day.</p>
        <p>So, he went directly to knock on the backyard door with moderate strength. And the sound of the three knocks were neither loud nor soft.</p>
        <p>That moderate sound of the knocks, however, caused Jiāng Chéng to feel uneasy.</p>
        <p>And when the guqin sound stopped, then the backyard door began to open, Jiāng Chéng felt the urge to turn around and leave at once.</p>
        <p>However, before he could complete his action, Jīn Líng grabbed his sleeve.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī opened the backyard door, and was slightly surprised to see Jiāng Chéng. However, since Jīn Líng was there, too, he didn’t say anything. He gave a greeting nod, moved aside and invited them to come in.</p>
        <p>Noticing that there were stone benches with a stone table under the magnolia tree, Jiāng Chéng walked straight there.</p>
        <p>Seeing Jiāng Chéng heading towards the magnolia tree, Lán WàngJī heaved a sigh of relief, since it removed the need of letting them enter the room.</p>
        <p>He also walked there and invited them to sit down. Then, without waiting them to speak first, Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng has formed a golden core, once more.”</p>
        <p>“Really?!” That one sentence dispelled Jiāng Chéng’s worries at once. And Jīn Líng nearly jumped up from his seat.</p>
        <p>“When that happened?” both, Jiāng Chéng and Jīn Líng, asked at the same time.</p>
        <p>Immediately, Jiāng Chéng regretted asking for that detail.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī calmly replied, “Wèi Yīng has formed the golden core the first night after he came out of a come.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng got a little bit upset, because he could tell that Lán WàngJī knew that they were worried about Wèi WúXiàn, that was why he spoke first.</p>
        <p>So, since he knew that they would be worried, why didn’t he send them a message as soon as possible?</p>
        <p>For the past two days, did Lán WàngJī have any idea of how much time he had spent thinking about that matter?</p>
        <p>He was absolutely not worried about Wèi WúXiàn, absolutely not. He had no desire to have something to do with Wèi WúXiàn’s loss of golden core, again.</p>
        <p>However, since himself was unwilling to meet Lán WàngJī for the past two days, therefore, Lán WàngJī was not in a position to inform him of the progress.</p>
        <p>After all, they didn’t have that kind of relation where they needed to get in touch to each other.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng then glanced at Lán WàngJī, and, suddenly, it crossed his mind, “If the golden core has been restored that night, wouldn’t it mean that...”</p>
        <p>All of a sudden, he was seized by an uncomfortable feeling, and could not help but move few inches away from Lán WàngJī. Somehow, he was relieved that Lán WàngJī didn’t tell him the details.</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng didn’t notice that Jiāng Chéng had stealthily changed his sitting position, and began to ask a series of questions, “How did he restore his golden core? Has it not completely shattered? Is the golden core stable now, and won’t break again?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī only replied, “His golden core has been reconstructed like it was before, and his golden core vessel is stable, so, there isn’t any problem at all.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng then asked again, “How did he manage to reconstructed it?” Jiāng Chéng of course didn’t tell him all the details.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī didn’t replied.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng then glared at Jīn Líng, and the latter thought that he got carried away asking GūsūLán’s secret cultivation, so, he swiftly changed the subject.</p>
        <p>“What about his memories? Will they be restored?” Jīn Líng asked.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “Yes.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng and Jīn Líng were very surprised, because they didn’t expect Lán WàngJī to be so confident in his reply.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī explained, “The specific reasons are inconvenient to state. So, all I can say is that, today, when he will wake up, he should be able to recall the events of the last few years.</p>
        <p>“If he wish to recall the rest of his memories, he will have to wait until tomorrow.”</p>
        <p>Since he could not bear to let Wèi WúXiàn remember in one go all the tragic events, Lán WàngJī divided the dream into two parts before proceeding with the incense burner.</p>
        <p>Last night, they entered the first part of the dream, and Lán WàngJī only let Wèi WúXiàn see the memories that both shared after he came back.</p>
        <p>Tonight, when they would enter the second part, he would go with him to Nightless Sky City.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng then asked, “How can you be so precise on when and how many memories he can recall?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī simply replied, “His memories are related to his golden core.”</p>
        <p>Immediately, Jiāng Chéng stopped asking questions. If the memories were related to the golden core, then, they were also related to their, ahem..., cultivation method.</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng was deeply saddened by the news of Wèi WúXiàn regaining his memories. He thought that he had made up a flawless lie. However, he didn’t expect that it would be so quickly exposed.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng then remembered how Wèi WúXiàn had put his arm around his shoulder, and a gave him a gentle punch on the stomach the day he woke up from a coma.</p>
        <p>His friendly habits back when they were teenagers, and his warm conviviality were all in that punch.</p>
        <p>When he would regain his memories, that would not happen again. From time to time, the two of them could only have meals together, mostly because Jīn Líng was around, nothing more.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng didn’t want to admit that it saddened him for no longer having that kind of friendship with Wèi WúXiàn. He just sat there quietly.</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng asked, “Is he sleeping?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.” replied Lán WàngJī, then, he added, “He will wake up soon.”</p>
        <p>In the last night dream, when he guided Wèi WúXiàn to relive the past events, the scenery kept on changing the whole night.</p>
        <p>Also, Wèi WúXiàn had collected at once all the fragments of his memories since he came back, so, he needed a good rest.</p>
        <p>To help Wèi WúXiàn sleep, Lán WàngJī burned incense while playing the guqin.</p>
        <p>Although he wanted to continue playing the guqin in the room, however, Lán WàngJī thought that it was not a good way of entertaining guests by leaving them waiting in the backyard.</p>
        <p>Still. Lán WàngJī didn’t feel like sitting outside for too long. His only desire, right now, was to be beside Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Then, it seemed to him that he heard a faint, almost imperceptible sound of the duvet being lifted, coming from inside the room.</p>
        <p>He stood up immediately, and said, “I will back in a minute.” Then, he quickly walked into the room, and closed the door behind him.</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng then asked his uncle, “Do you think that he will remember everything?”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng recalled the rumours that were rampant in Yúnmèng territory, and, in a gloomy tone, he replied, “Even though he won’t remember everything, other people will help him recall them.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng felt depressed, and said, “Couldn’t it be the same as before?”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng remained silent.</p>
        <p>There was no way that it would be the same as before, because, this time, he had a golden core.</p>
    </div>

        <br />
        <p>After a short moment, the door slid open, and Wèi WúXiàn walked out from the room, wearing white, cloud-patterned robes.</p>
        <p>His black long hair was tied low, at the back of the next, with a white ribbon. Upon a closer look, his hair was actually fastened with GūsūLán forehead ribbon.</p>
        <p>“Young Leader Jīn, did you come to see me?” said Wèi WúXiàn with a bright smile of his face.</p>
        <p>Then, he turned towards Jiāng Chéng and said, while still smiling, “Leader Jiāng is also here.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng had never heard Wèi WúXiàn talking to Jiāng Chéng in such a teasing and casual way.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng was also surprised. Then, he remembered what Lán WàngJī said earlier: ‘he will only recall the recent events’.</p>
        <p>He had remembered something, but not everything, at least for the time being. Therefore, his attitude was still friendly.</p>
        <p>This friendliness, however, would last only for one day. After today, it wouldn’t happen again.</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng looked at Wèi WúXiàn and seemed to be puzzled, he asked, “Why do you look slightly different? Your appearance seems to have changed a little bit.”</p>
        <p>“I’ve become more handsome, right?” remarked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng replied, “It’s strange. You’re not looking like yourself. You have actually become good-looking, just like the appearance of our Jīn family.”</p>
        <p>At first glance, Jiāng Chéng failed to notice it, because GūsūLán clothes on Wèi WúXiàn was really eye-catching.</p>
        <p>Only then, after Jīn Líng’s remark, he realised that Wèi WúXiàn’s appearance became more like his former one.</p>
        <p>Also, it turned out to be the face that was engraved deeply in Jiāng Chéng’s memory.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng then thought, “No wonder Jīn Líng thinks that it’s strange. It is indeed extraordinary.”</p>
        <p>At that moment, Lán WàngJī came out of the room, and joined them on the table. He brought along an exquisite tea set, and began to pour the tea into the cups for everyone, while keeping an elegant posture.</p>
        <p>It was the white peony tea, which was always abundant in Jīnlíntái, and was Jīn Líng’s favourite tea.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng thought, “He has chosen this tea only for Jīn Líng’s sake.” Then, he tried hard to suppress the disappointing feeling in him.</p>
        <p>With a complaining voice, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Lán Zhàn, Jīn Líng said that my appearance now is strange.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī simply replied, “Since you have now a golden core, your face ought to be similar to the one of your original self.”</p>
        <p>“Have you really formed a golden core?” Jīn Líng asked.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn replied, “Of course, I have.”</p>
        <p>Then, to show that he had a golden core, Wèi WúXiàn began to produce a red spiritual light that gathered in the palm of his hand. Once completed, it looked like a red ball set on fire, and undulated like a flame.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng and Jīn Líng noticed that, for someone who newly formed a golden core, Wèi WúXiàn had a strong spiritual power and a solid foundation.</p>
        <p>However, Jīn Líng said, “Your spiritual power is feeble, not really impressive.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn laughed, then said, “Of course, I can’t compete against you, the young leader of LánlíngJīn sect. I will only last two or three hundred moves, if I fight a duel with the young leader.”</p>
        <p>“You will last at most one hundred moves.” Jīn Líng exclaimed, “If Xiānzǐ fights along with me, then, it will be at most then moves.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was about to ask who Xiānzǐ was, when he recalled that it was Jīn Líng’s spiritual dog, he said, “If we exchange moves, it is a duel between you and me only. Why will you feel the need of calling Xiānzǐ into our fight?”</p>
        <p>Unhappy, Jīn Líng said, “You remember that Xiānzǐ is my spiritual dog. You indeed recall many things.”</p>
        <p>“I only recall a few memories.” corrected Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>He only saw the memories that Lán WàngJī let him see in the incense burner.</p>
        <p>Before diving into the realm of his unconscious mind to gather the fragments of his memories, Wèi WúXiàn planned on entering the dream once again, tonight.</p>
        <p>Last night, he only saw the good memories. Tonight, he had to work hard to recall the bad memories, too.</p>
        <p>So, Jiāng Chéng’s assumption was incorrect, because Wèi WúXiàn didn’t remember all the events that happened after he came back.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng then asked, “There won’t be any unforeseen issue with the golden core, right?”</p>
        <p>“No, there won’t.” Lán WàngJī replied, “His golden core is completely stable.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng said, “You should stay at home to recover and strengthen you body. Don’t go out wandering around, again.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled, and said, “Thank you so much, Young Leader Jīn, for your advice.” then, he turned towards Jiāng Chéng, “Leader Jiāng, thank you for your concern.”</p>
        <p>Here we go again with his teasing way of talking and friendly attitude.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng could not tell how he felt for being treated so kindly by Wèi WúXiàn. He didn’t allow himself to be a person who liked to reminisce about the old days.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then carried on showing Jīn Líng how he could control the flow of his spiritual power.</p>
        <p>Through his fingertips, he released some red spiritual strings as thin as a thread of silk. Then, progressively, these strings coiled to form a bud of a flower.</p>
        <p>And then, gracefully, that flower bud bloomed, the petals, one by one, slowly opened up.</p>
        <p>“This is exactly what he used to do to attract girls, when he was a teenager.” thought Jiāng Chéng, “This guy, after getting a golden core, starts to show off.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng then remarked, “You used to like flaunting your swordsmanship in front of people.”</p>
        <p>“That’s because I was a kid. Who can stay young forever.” protested Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>He turned into a kid after forming a golden core. And, from now on, he could perform his swordplay only for Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Now that Wèi WúXiàn had a new golden core, Jiāng Chéng felt like a heavy burden had been removed from his shoulders, he thought, “I no longer own him anything.”</p>
        <p>Then, from his sleeve, he took out a purple box, placed it on the table, and, in a lukewarm tone, he said, “This is your congratulation gift for forming a golden core.”</p>
        <p>“Jiāng Chéng, you’re too kind.” said Wèi WúXiàn, then, with a smile, he took the box, and opened it.</p>
        <p>The gift was a pair of magnificent pendants with a lotus design on them. Each pendant had a tassel attached to the end, and the two tassels had different colours, a purple and a blue.</p>
        <p>As a matter of fact, Jiāng Chéng’s gift was more suitable for the wedding, to congratulate the couple for getting married.</p>
        <p>However, at their wedding ceremony, Jiāng Chéng felt uneasy to give a wedding gift, so he chose another gilt, instead. And, together with Jīn Líng, they gave their gifts to the couple.</p>
        <p>Although Jiāng Chéng’s gift back then was priceless, however, it was not meant to wish a good marriage to the couple.</p>
        <p>“HánGuāng-Jūn is from Lán* family, so I chose a blue tassel for him.” said Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <small>*Lán means blue colour.</small>
        <p>The colour of the tassel should have been pink for the bride. However, Lán WàngJī was male, so it was awkward to give him a pendant with a pink tassel.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said inwardly, “Jiāng Chéng is really thoughtful for choosing a blue tassel for Lán Zhàn, and a purple one for me.”</p>
        <p>“Jiāng Chéng, you are indeed wise and sensible. Thank you.” said Wèi WúXiàn with a lovely smile on his face.</p>
        <p>Then, he took out the pendant with the blue tassel from the box, and, wanting to see how it would look like on Lán WàngJī, he placed the pendant against Lán WàngJī’s waist, while he was still holding it, and, without even realising it, he leaned on Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s natural behaviour caused Jiāng Chéng to shiver. The latter then coughed to clear his voice, “Be more discreet. Don’t just throw yourself into his arms with that face of yours.”</p>
        <p>“What’s wrong with my face?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng replied, “Your face is not suitable for a cut-sleeve*. I had barely got used to that pretty face you had before.”</p>
        <small>*cut-sleeve is a term that means male homosexual.</small>
        <p>With indifference, Wèi WúXiàn shrugged his shoulders, and said, “Leader Jiāng, please do get used to this face as soon as possible, because I can’t restrain myself in front of Lán Zhàn.”</p>
        <p>Then, he resumed his little activity around Lán WàngJī’s waist.</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng then said, “You guys can just wear the pendants when you come to Lotus Piers. There’s no need for you to wear them every day.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī took hold of the mischievous hand of Wèi WúXiàn, reached for the pendant and put it back inside the box, then, he said, “Thank you, Leader Jiāng.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then turned towards Jīn Líng, and asked, “Young Leader Jīn, have you not brought any gift for me?”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng did not expect his uncle to bring something, so, he said, “I am a junior. Why do you want me to give you a gift?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn replied, “I’ve formed a golden core. Don’t you want to congratulate me?”</p>
        <p>“Congratulation!” said Jīn Líng without being sincere, “It must have been hard, even with your talent.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “A-Líng, why are you like this? How about giving me a few jars of wine from LánlíngJīn?”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng then said, “I will give you fifty jars of wine that are more than twenty years old. However, you can drink them only when HánGuāng-Jūn allows you to drink.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled, and said, “Young Leader Jīn, you are indeed very wealthy.”</p>
        <p>Then, the four of them chatted for a short while. And the more friendly Wèi WúXiàn became as before towards Jiāng Chéng, the more cautious the latter became.</p>
        <p>Then, Jiāng Chéng said that he had some matter to deal with, and, along with Jīn Líng, they took their leave.</p>
        <p>As they stepped out of Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù’s main gate, Jīn Líng said, “Uncle, it turns out that Wèi WúXiàn and you can get along so well.”</p>
        <p>“What do you mean by that?” Jiāng Chéng asked.</p>
        <p>“You know what I mean.” replied Jīn Líng, then, he said, “Uncle, I think it’s good for both of you to be on friendly terms.”</p>
        <p>Jiāng Chéng said, “Children should talk less, when they don’t know how to judge a situation.”</p>
        <p>“I’m no longer a kid.” protested Jīn Líng, then, he tried to advise him, “Uncle, from now on, both of you should always be like this.”</p>
        <p>“Don’t talk nonsense!” said Jiāng Chéng, “This is something I can decide on my own.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng didn’t have anything else to say after that.</p>
        <p>Although both of them knew that Wèi WúXiàn had always been broad-minded, and never bore any grudge against them, still, there was an awkward feeling that still lingered.</p>
        <p>And also, they knew that, after he married Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn became even more open-minded and very happy.</p>

        <br />
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn had finally recovered all his lost memories. He wrote down the character ‘Qíng’ on a piece of paper, drawing each stroke with great respect and solemnity.</p>
        <p>The strokes were delicately and beautifully drawn, and yet, the character conveyed a powerful feeling.</p>
        <p>‘The lady is gone. You left alone, in great panic, to see her bones crushed into ashes, then scattered in the air.’*</p>
        <small>*This quotation describes the death of Wēn Qíng, Wēn Níng’s elder sister.</small>
        <p>Little Apple, the abandoned baby girl whom Wèi WúXiàn rescued, had been given the name of ‘Qíng’ in the memory of Wēn Qíng.</p>
        <p>“Lán Qíng.” said Lán WàngJī, who was holding the sleeping baby in the crook of his arm.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “A good daughter should be like Wēn Qíng.”</p>
        <p>In a very low voice, Lán WàngJī agreed, “Uh huh.”</p>
        <p>“We just give her a birth name, and leave your uncle to choose the courtesy name when she grows up.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>When he turned his head towards Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn was astonished in reading Lán WàngJī’s facial expression.</p>
        <p>Uncertain, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Are you jealous?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī only said, “Wēn Qíng was wonderful woman with an outstanding medical skills and a strong character.”</p>
        <p>With certainty, this time, Wèi WúXiàn said, “You are jealous.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then nodded his head very slightly, so slightly that his nod was almost unnoticeable, while his ears turned faintly red in embarrassment.</p>
        <p>Back then, in the cave* of the burial mound, he saw Wèi WúXiàn pretending to be dizzy in front of Wēn Qíng, and happily joking around.</p>
        <small>*It’s the cave that Wèi WúXiàn occupied while living with Wēn family, the last branch of Wēn sect.</small>
        <p>He saw Wēn Qíng unrestrainedly swept all kind of stuff, which was on Wèi WúXiàn’s stone bed, to the floor.</p>
        <p>He watched Wèi WúXiàn pleasantly chatting with Wēn Qíng, and teasing A-Yuàn about tea leaves and radish seeds.</p>
        <p>Of course, he was jealous.</p>
        <p>There was a cheerful talk and laughter in the cave, only him felt out of place, like an outsider.</p>
        <p>He had seen Wèi WúXiàn being gloomy, arrogant, playful and prankish. However, he had rarely seen him being relaxed and carefree, as though he was surrounded by family members.</p>
        <p>He used to think that, one day, Wèi WúXiàn would probably get married and have children.</p>
        <p>However, there hadn’t been such a woman to whom Wèi WúXiàn could take as a wife yet. Since, Luó QīngYáng was only an acquaintance, and Jiāng YànLí had already someone she loved.</p>
        <p>So, Lán WàngJī had pretended that this probability didn’t exist, until he met Wēn Qíng.</p>
        <p>She was brilliant and beautiful, well-known for her medical skills. Even her temperament was as bold and unruly as Wèi WúXiàn’s. And, together, they were very compatible.</p>
        <p>People said that Wèi WúXiàn was the ruler of the burial mound, exorcising ghosts and slaying demons.</p>
        <p>In fact, he mostly spent his days laughing and making jokes with his close friends.</p>
        <p>In comparison with Wèi WúXiàn and Wēn Qíng’s chat, when Lán WàngJī talked to Wèi WúXiàn, and with him being not good at talking, they often ended up being at odds, only after a few words.</p>
        <p>So, at that time, he suddenly turned around and left the cave without saying anything.</p>
        <p>Back then, that was probably the time Lán WàngJī felt deeply jealous.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn also recalled that day in the cave, then realised that, back then, Lán WàngJī was extremely jealous, and his jealousy still lingered even now.</p>
        <p>He didn’t have the heart to joke about it. On the contrary, he was filled with sorrow to see Lán WàngJī in such a state of mind.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn gently hugged Lán WàngJī by passing his arms under Lán Qíng’s head and feet, so that their both arms formed a bed for the sleeping baby.</p>
        <p>Then, he put his forehead against Lán WàngJī’s chin, and, in a low voice, he said, “That day, after you left the burial mound, Wēn Qíng asked me:</p>
        <p>“‘It’s unusual to see you bringing someone here. You never bring anyone here before, why did you make an exception for HánGuāng-Jūn? And why the two of you call each other by your birth names*?’”</p>
        <small>*The way two people address each other tells others how they are related. For example, calling someone by his/her birth name indicates intimacy. However, Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn have started to call each other in that way before even being in intimate relationship.</small>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then lowered his head, and kissed Wèi WúXiàn on the forehead. And then, he said, “Wèi Yīng, I know.”</p>
        <p>“She was already gone.” thought Lán WàngJī, “Being jealous is meaningless and disrespectful for the deceased.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn shook his head, and said, “Lán Zhàn, you don’t know everything. You only know that I have treated you differently since we were teenagers.”</p>
        <p>He sighed, then resumed, “Wēn Qíng had someone she loved, and that person was from another branch of Wēn sect. The two of them had known each other since childhood, and grown up together. They had already talked about marriage.</p>
        <p>“Later on, the war broke out. Wēn Qíng’s branch was specialised in medical studies only. They were not involved in the war.</p>
        <p>“However, her fiancé’s branch was not only involved in the Shooting Sun campaign, but also clashed with the YúnmèngJiāng sect on the battlefield.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn took a deep breath, then, in low voice, he carried on, “The body of her fiancé had never been found.”</p>
        <p>A self-deprecating smile appeared at the corners of his mouth, he continued, “Maybe he died at my hands. Who knows?</p>
        <p>“One day, when Wēn Qíng got drunk, she told me that because of the death of his fiancé, she didn’t seek help from Lotus Piers immediately after her sect had been defeated.”</p>
        <p>However, when Wēn Níng, her young brother, was in trouble, she rushed to ask Wèi WúXiàn for help, which led Wèi WúXiàn to go to Jīnlíntái, threaten them to tell the whereabouts of Wēn Níng.</p>
        <p>But, when they found Wēn Níng, it was too late, and Wèi WúXiàn became the enemy of the LánlíngJīn sect.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn carried on, “She was really drunk, and kept on apologising to me, telling that she regretted for not coming straight away to me for help, that, afterwards, she had pressed me to help her, leaving no room for me to refuser.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī shook his head, and said, “It was not her fault, nor was yours. Since you cannot read people’s mind, therefore, it is impossible to guard yourself against their scheme.</p>
        <p>“Qióngqí Path was heavily guarded by LánlíngJīn’s people. So, how could one explain how Wēn Qíng, alone, managed to escape under their surveillance, and travel all the way down south to Lotus Piers to ask for help?</p>
        <p>“After the war, many people knew that both, Wēn Qíng and Wēn Níng, had done YúnmèngJiāng sect a favour. So, they knew that she would come to you.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, they had let her escape on purpose. They had set up this scheme to get you.</p>
        <p>“‘A man is innocent, but he is guilty of carrying a jade.’*”</p>
        <small>*This expression means someone’s talent will arouse the envy of others.</small>
        <p>In an earnest tone, Lán WàngJī carried on, “Wèi Yīng, if, back then, they could not use Wēn Qíng and Wēn Níng, they would definitely find other means.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled, he also knew that it was a trap, however, it didn’t stopped him from helping Wēn Qíng.</p>
        <p>He said, “Anyway, Ér-gēge, I want you to know that I’ve never had any feelings for Wēn Qíng. And, you should also know that she was not head over heels in love with me, either.”</p>
        <p>And, in a humorous tone, he carried on, “Someone said that I am a genius, handsome and romantic. Of course, it’s hard for a girl, who sees me, not to turn around and look at me again... Aargh!”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī stopped Wèi WúXiàn’s nonsense talk by giving him a sudden deep kiss, then, he bit Wèi WúXiàn’s lower lip, out of jealousy.</p>
        <p>“Haaah...” Wèi WúXiàn moaned in pain, his lower lip became sensually tinted with a shade of red, and Lán WàngJī’s kisses made Wèi WúXiàn’s lips become moist and slightly shiny.</p>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn, once more, put his forehead against Lán WàngJī’s chin, and asked, “Ér-gēge, are you feeling better now? You’re no longer jealous regarding Wēn Qíng?”</p>
        <p>“I’m fine.” he replied.</p>
        <p>At that moment, the little Lán Qíng stirred a little bit inside her blanket, turned her head to one side, then, she carried on sleeping soundly.</p>
        <p>“You told me that Wēn Qíng committed suicide by cutting her own throat.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“That’s right.” confirmed Lán WàngJī, then, he added, “At Jīnlíntái, Wēn Qíng took the blame for her sect’s evil deeds, then, she put her sword against the neck and slashed her throat.</p>
        <p>Her suicide made Jīn GuāngShàn* so furious that, in order to vent his anger, he whipped her body in front of everyone present there, causing Wēn Níng to go crazy and out of control.”</p>
        <small>*Jīn GuāngShàn is Jīn Líng’s grandfather.</small>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “It’s good thing that she didn’t suffer too much before dying. If she had not committed suicide, they would have tortured her, made her suffer before killing her.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī then said, “Let’s work hard to raise Lán Qíng in warm and comfortable environment.”</p>
        <p>Then, he asked, “Wèi Yīng, do you want us to adopt her officially, and register her as our child?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn thought about it, then said, “I don’t think it’s a good idea. Just imagine how much attention many people would put on the adopted daughter of HánGuāng-Jūn and Yílíng Lǎozǔ.”</p>
        <p>“If you are worried about other people’s criticism...” Lán WàngJī started to say, but Wèi WúXiàn interrupted him.</p>
        <p>“Yes, but it’s not all. Firstly, you and I are both males, raising a daughter would be really inconvenient. And secondly, ...”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn paused and looked into his lovely eyes, he resumed, “Secondly, among all children we look after on a daily basis, which one of them we don’t consider as our own child?</p>
        <p>“Registration is just a mere formality. The most important is how much you care for them, not to stick with the formal ritual.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī asked, “This is how you want it to be?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled, and said, “If we adopt Lán Qíng, I’m afraid that it will cause other young children to be jealous of her.”</p>
        <p>He carried on, “You know how popular I am among those kids, right?.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī smiled, and said, “I know.”</p>
        <p>“In other words, all those kids are our children.” said Wèi WúXiàn, “So, favouring one over others, or treating one differently than the others will not be a good thing for our little Lán Qíng.</p>
        <p>“It’s better for her to be raised in the convent. And, from time to time, we can look after her.”</p>
        <p>“Okay. We’ll do as you said.” Lán WàngJī agreed.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then remarked, “Come to think of it, I said that all the kids living in Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù are our children. Does it not sound like I gave birth to your offspring, a bunch of them?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī’s ears turned slightly red, he said, “You are talking nonsense, again.”</p>
        <p>The present moment was filled with joy and happiness.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then smiled sweetly at him, stood on tiptoe and kissed his HánGuāng-Jūn.</p>

        <br />
        <p>“So, WàngJī,” said Lán XīChén, “to recap what you said, you have promised those people from Wěishàn Village that GūsūLán will pay for their losses, if the authorities fail to compensate them on time?”</p>
        <p>Lán XīChén placed the black piece that he was holding on the Go board, then, he gracefully picked up the teacup and took a sip.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī appeared to be completely absorbed in the Go game, still, he calmly replied, “Yes.”</p>
        <p>Lán XīChén said, “Rumour has it that WúXiàn forced those people out of their village, and destroyed their ancestral graveyard. That you condoned his behaviour, and promised to compensate the villagers for all their losses.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Xiōng-zhǎng, I’d like to emphasise on one point that Lán Zhàn said. Although he gave his promise for the compensation, however, the village chief has already signed the compensatory agreement, and this was what the authorities wanted for a long time.</p>
        <p>“So, relocating the villagers in order to divert the flood, as well as compensating them are authorities’s responsibilities.”</p>
        <p>Lán XīChén then gently touched the folded copy of the compensation plan that was placed next to the Go board, he said, “The village chief has signed it. However, the nine committee members have not signed the compensatory agreement yet.”</p>
        <p>“WúXiàn,” Lán XīChén looked at Wèi WúXiàn, and, with a gentle tone, he carried on, “Leader Jiāng dispatched someone to pick up a copy of the compensation plan from the authorities.</p>
        <p>“And then, they printed more than one hundred thousand of copies, and distributed them all over the Yúnmèng territory.</p>
        <p>“Leader Jiāng is extremely concerned about those rumours.”</p>
        <p>In a low voice, Wèi WúXiàn said, “But no one will believe that those copies are from the original document.”</p>
        <p>He thought to himself, “Such ingrained prejudice against me cannot be corrected so easily. With my notoriety, no matter what I say or do, people won’t trust me. Unfortunately, I have implicated Lán Zhàn in this matter.”</p>
        <p>In a very kind tone, as if he was instructing a junior, Lán XīChén said, “The compensatory agreement is indeed incomplete, and there are some omissions.</p>
        <p>“The authorities deliberately delay the payment, and are unwilling to come forward to explain the situation. And people tend to believe the rumours.”</p>
        <p>Rumours are sensational, they are full of drama and excitement. Rumours are more interesting than anything else for most of people, they dispel their boredom.</p>
        <br />
        <p>... ... ...</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, those rumours continued to spread.</p>
        <p>“So far, GūsūLán sect has had a great reputation, and HánGuāng-Jūn has been famous for so long. Why not drag them down from their throne? Why not trample on them?</p>
        <p>“If you can stand out from the crowd by pointing out others’s flaws, and seeing through the whole conspiracy, then, you’ll be able to make up a story, and show that you are insightful, rational and objective.</p>
        <p>“You can show that those upright cultivators are not different from common people.</p>
        <p>“These kind of rumours make common people feel happy.</p>
        <p>“Being able to belittle those mighty cultivators will give you a sense of victory and superiority.</p>
        <p>“Making jokes about GūsūLán sect, and exposing HánGuāng-Jūn’s true face will be very exciting for the passers-by.”</p>
        <p>... ... ...</p>
        <br />
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Xiōng-zhǎng, it was my fault for not giving it a second thought before making that promise.”</p>
        <p>Lán XīChén said, “It doesn’t matter. We’ll work out to find an alternative way to deal with this matter.”</p>
        <p>He then added, “It’s only a hundred households, it’s not like GūsūLán can’t afford to pay the compensation.”</p>
        <p>Indeed, for GūsūLán, it was not a significant sum of money, however, the matter ought not be settled that way.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “I know that GūsūLán is wealthy, but...”</p>
        <p>All of a sudden, Lán XīChén asked, “WúXiàn, do you have money?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn gulped.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī hurriedly exclaimed, “Xiōng-zhǎng...”</p>
        <p>Lán XīChén gently replied, “WàngJī, WúXiàn can also make some money.”</p>
        <p>Then, he carried on talking to Wèi WúXiàn, “WúXiàn, start making talismans for sale. An evil-repel talisman made personally by Yílíng Lǎozǔ will certainly attract a lot of people wanting to buy it.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī cast a disappointing look at his elder brother.</p>
        <p>Lán XīChén then smiled, and said, “WàngJī, and WúXiàn, I have been in seclusion for a long time, leaving both of you to take care of everything.</p>
        <p>“Now that I came out of seclusion, I will take full responsibility of this matter.”</p>
        <p>Then, he said to his young brother, “WàngJī, just trust me.”</p>
        <p>“All right.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Then, after a short pause, he pointed out, “It was my fault for making that promise without knowing that the compensatory agreement was incomplete. Moreover, it never crossed my mind to check the compensation plan beforehand.</p>
        <p>“However, before stepping in, Wèi Yīng first required to see the copy of the compensation plan from drill instructor Zhāng.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī’s remark warmed Wèi WúXiàn’s heart.</p>
        <p>Lán XīChén smiled, and said, “I can easily guess that, because, WàngJī, since you were a kid, you’ve never had any notion of the use of money.”</p>
        <p>Using the table of Go game as a cover, Wèi WúXiàn sneakily moved his hand towards Lán WàngJī, and, with one finger, he tickled Lán WàngJī’s palm a few times.</p>
        <p>As a result, Lán WàngJī’s ears turned slightly red, and he quickly took hold of Wèi WúXiàn’s hand to prevent him from fooling around.</p>
        <p>Lán XīChén noticed Lán WàngJī’s expression, and teasingly said, “The two of you, can you stop flirting in front of me.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was startled, and felt a little bit embarrassed, he wanted to pull his hand, but Lán WàngJī held it firmly, he didn’t want to let go of Wèi WúXiàn’s hand.</p>
        <p>Lán XīChén could not conceal his amusement, he said, “WàngJī, you really become bold.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn hurriedly said, “Xiōng-zhǎng, please, stop teasing him.”</p>
        <p>“I won’t dare do that.”  Lán XīChén said, “Besides, you are here to defend him.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled, and proudly said, “I will keep on defending him.”</p>
        <p>He was now more at ease, and his worry, which he felt earlier about implicating Lán WàngJī, vanished into thin air.</p>
        <p>“WúXiàn, I’d like to talk to you alone.” said Lán XīChén, “WàngJī, can you go to see the Third Uncle*? He has already compiled more than fifty percent of books on the history of the previous dynasty, he will need your assistance.”</p>
        <small>*Like in Lán WàngJī’s case, he is sometimes addressed as Lán Ér-gōngzǐ (second son of Lán family), same goes for uncles; second uncle, third uncle, etc.</small>
        <p>“Okay.” Lán WàngJī agreed.</p>
        <p>He then pressed Wèi WúXiàn’s hand very gently before letting it go, which amused Lán XīChén even more.</p>
        <p>As soon as Lán WàngJī left, Wèi WúXiàn said straight away, “Xiōng-zhǎng, I don’t want to pay for the compensation in place of the authorities.”</p>
        <p>What is done is done. Wèi WúXiàn didn’t feel that he had done something wrong. So, naturally, he was unwilling to pay for it.</p>
        <p>“WúXiàn, can you take WàngJī’s place, and play this Go with me?” Lán XīChén said, “Don’t play your own style, use WàngJī’s style instead. I am keen to know how WàngJī would have solved this game.”</p>
        <p>“Okay.” Wèi WúXiàn agreed.</p>
        <p>He easily guessed the next move that Lán WàngJī would have made, he then picked up a white piece from its bowl, and, calmly, placed it on the Go board.</p>
        <p>Lán XīChén smiled, and said, “WúXiàn, you said that you don’t want to pay for the compensation. What do you have in mind?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “<em>Repay evil with kindness, then, how will you repay kindness?</em>*</p>
        <small>*This old saying means rewarding people for poor behaviour will encourage them to act even worse in the future.</small>
        <p>“A sudden heavy rain turned residential areas into a river. If those villagers didn’t move out, they would be in danger.</p>
        <p>“Xiōng-zhǎng, I don’t think that Lán Zhàn and I are at fault. So, why GūsūLán has to bear the responsibility?</p>
        <p>“The flood was a big threat for many residents living in downstream areas. If I have to choose again, I would still force them to move out.”</p>
        <p>Lán XīChén said, “WúXiàn, do you really think that I want GūsūLán to pay for the compensation?</p>
        <p>“If we pay for it, it will mean that GūsūLán admits that WàngJī and you are at fault.”</p>
        <p>Surprised, Wèi WúXiàn uttered, “Xiōng-zhǎng, you didn’t have any intention of paying for the compensation?”</p>
        <p>Lán XīChén smiled, and restated what Wèi WúXiàn said, “<em>Repay evil with kindness, then, how will you repay kindness?</em></p>
        <p>“WúXiàn, you are absolutely right. I also think that we should <em>repay evil with justice, and kindness with kindness.</em>”</p>
        <p>“Then, Xiōng-zhǎng, why do you want me to sell talismans for?” asked Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“WúXiàn, just think about it.” Lán XīChén said, “There were only a few villagers that have been relocated, so, why the rumours are spreading so fast, and all over Yúnmèng territory?</p>
        <p>“Besides, Leader Jiāng would never let those rumours spread to such an extent.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn ventured, “Do you think that the authorities are behind all this?”</p>
        <p>“What the authorities wish is not to have to pay for the compensation at all.” said Lán XīChén, “However, the fact that the prefect had issued a relocation order every early spring is their weak point, they can’t deny it. So, they would rather not to have this matter spread around.</p>
        <p>“WúXiàn, don’t you think that those villagers would first try to get the authorities to pay for the compensation, instead of forcing GūsūLán to pay for it?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Xiōng-zhǎng, what do you have in mind?”</p>
        <p>“WúXiàn, you are very powerful.” said Lán XīChén, “It is said that Yílíng Lǎozǔ can defeat thousands of troops.</p>
        <p>“Once someone’s strength is far more superior, it’s easy for people to guard themselves against you.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn stayed silent. He used to think that he was powerful, however, a tree that stands in the wood can be destroyed by the wind.</p>
        <p>No matter how powerful he was, he could not protect people he wanted to protect so much. He was not strong enough to fight against the world.</p>
        <p>And, right now, he was still not strong enough to defend his beloved ones against the pervasive malice that was looming out there.</p>
        <p>Lán XīChén smiled at him, and said, “WúXiàn you are powerful, and GūsūLán sect is not weak either. Since wangji and you are already a married couple, you should rely more on GūsūLán, your family.</p>
        <p>“You have grown up a lot compared to what you used to be. Wangji and you should feel free to do what you want to do. I believe that you can do whatever you like without breaking the rules.</p>
        <p>“Since GūsūLán has accepted you as Wangji’s partner, and recorded you into the family registration, so, we can protect not only the you now, but also the you of the past, and the you of the future.”</p>
        <p>“I’ve got ahead of myself this time.” said Wèi WúXiàn, a little bit embarrassed.</p>

        <br />
        <p>“WàngJī is a natural upright person, and, as for you, you have a big heart.” said Lán XīChén, “The two of you should work together to solve to this matter.</p>
        <p>“And, above all, you should not blame yourself. I don’t think that WàngJī blames himself. Since both of you think that what you have done was the right thing, so be it.”</p>
        <p>Lán XīChén smiled, then carried on, “I’m not saying this as the elder brother, but as the head of GūsūLán sect.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was extremely moved, he stood up, adjusted his robes, and solemnly bowed, with his left hand turned into a fist, while the right hand rested flat against the fist, and his both arms, halfway, stretched forward, earnestly, he said, “Yes, Zōng-zhǔ*.”</p>
        <small>*Zōng-zhǔ means the head of a sect</small>
        <p>Lán XīChén stood up, held Wèi WúXiàn’s arms, and made him stand upright, “WúXiàn, there’s no need for you to be so courteous. If you want to do something, then do it for GūsūLán.</p>
        <p>“It’s true that you have done a lot for GūsūLán so far. And, since you have now joined our clan, it’s not a bad idea to sell talismans and make money for the clan.</p>
        <p>“You have a great talent, there’s no need to hide it. And, for this occasion, WàngJī has a surprise for you.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn didn’t quite understand the reason why Lán XīChén wanted him to make money by selling talismans, still he agreed, “Okay.” then, curious, he asked, “What kind of surprise Lán Zhàn has for me?”</p>
        <p>“I can’t tell you what it is, otherwise, that would spoil the surprise.” replied Lán XīChén, “In a few days, WàngJī will reveal it to you.”</p>
        <p>Then, both of them carried on playing the Go game. Steadily and calmly, Wèi WúXiàn used Lán WàngJī's game strategy until the end, and managed to defeat Lán XīChén by two pieces.</p>
        <p>As Wèi WúXiàn took his leave, Lán XīChén watched him walking towards Jingshi, observing his quick and energetic pace, his broad sleeves waving under the rhythm of his movement. He stared at him with admiration, then, he said to himself, “WàngJī is finally happy.”</p>
        <p>Outside the window of his room, the courtyard garden was a blaze of colour in this summertime.</p>
        <p>In the garden, the pink hortensias were intertwined with the blue ones. The pale pink blossoms were like saying that the spring had not ended yet, while the blue blossoms were like dreaming of an early summer.</p>
        <p>Those hortensias were given to him by an old friend. Back then, they were just two seedlings. Now, they had grown into dense bushes.</p>
        <p>Lán XīChén turned his eyes in the direction of LánlíngJīn, and said to himself, “A-Yáo*, this time, I will try your method.”</p>
        <small>*A-Yáo also known as Jīn GuāngYáo is the former leader of LánlíngJīn sect, and sworn brother of Lán XīChén.</small>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>... ... ...</p>
        <br />
        <p>“GūsūLán has accepted the condition of Wěishàn’s villagers, which is to pay them three times the compensation!”</p>
        <p>Although there was no evidence of this acceptance, and GūsūLán hadn’t said anything about it, and also, the villagers were unwilling to comment on the matter, still, this rumour had been spreading like wildfire.</p>
        <p>This triple compensation rumour had been not only widely circulating, but it also overshadowed the previous rumours about the villagers being unfairly treated by Yílíng Lǎozǔ and HánGuāng-Jūn.</p>
        <p>“What if GūsūLán really intends to pay that huge amount of money, this will mean that those villagers wanted to keep it secret, and eagerly look forward to it.”</p>
        <p>Those gossips were now the talk of the town.</p>
        <p>“Ever since he has joined GūsūLán sect, Yílíng Lǎozǔ has kept a low profile, and he rarely appears in public.</p>
        <p>“But now, for the first time, it has been spreading that he is selling talismans that ward off evil spirits for households, in order to make money.”</p>
        <p>“But why would Yílíng Lǎozǔ feel the need of making money? Is he broke?”</p>
        <p>Yílíng Lǎozǔ's atrocities of commanding demons and corpses, and killing opponents on the battlefields were just a topic of conversation after dinner for common people. It was as illusory as a legendary story, too far away from their lives.</p>
        <p>However, when it came to money, which was the necessity that everyone needed for their daily expenses, their conversation took an interesting turn.</p>
        <p>While doubling the compensation represented already many years of savings for most of households, the triple compensation was undoubtedly covetable.</p>
        <p>“Why all of a sudden should those villagers get rich?”</p>
        <p>Those people who previously sympathised with the villagers, and condemned the evil deeds of Yílíng Lǎozǔ and HánGuāng-Jūn, had now changed their opinion.</p>
        <p>Before the triple compensation rumour, people doubted about the validity of the compensation plan that Jiāng Chéng had distributed all over Yúnmèng territory.</p>
        <p>After that rumour, however, people began to believe in the copy of the compensation plan that had been given to them.</p>
        <p>“Since this compensation plan is really what the authorities have established, and also their village chief has signed it, then it’s true that those villagers want to obtain more money.”</p>
        <p>“HánGuāng-Jūn and Yílíng Lǎozǔ happened to pass by and got entangled. The villagers tried to extort money on spot but failed.</p>
        <p>“Then, later on, they spread rumours in order to coerce GūsūLán to compensate them. So, GūsūLán agrees to pay three times the compensation.”</p>
        <p>“Also, Yílíng Lǎozǔ sets up a stall to sell talismans in order to supplement their income, which is very embarrassing.”</p>
        <p>This was the conclusion that some people came up with, and spread it around as what truly happened between those villagers and GūsūLán.</p>
        <p>Oulang, a money-lender company, had sneakily contacted the ‘about-to-become-rich’ villagers to offer them loans.</p>
        <p>However, it was ridiculous of those villagers to believe that they would receive three times their original compensation money.</p>
        <p>Some people, however, doubted about the triple compensation. Besides, GūsūLán hadn’t publicly admitted it yet.</p>
        <p>Soon after that rumour, yet another rumour was circulating, saying that Yílíng Lǎozǔ was not good at making talismans, and failed to raise a decent amount of money.</p>
        <p>As a result, another version of the compensation plan was issued, in which the villagers agreed to reduce the triple compensation to a double one, since three times the compensation was indeed too high.</p>
        <p>And it was decided that GūsūLán would pay half of the compensation, and the authorities would pay the other half, which was the same amount of money that was on the first version of the compensation plan.</p>
        <p>And also, GūsūLán would pay the integrity of their part in a lump sum, while the authorities would pay their part over three years by increasing taxes on the lower reaches of Han River.</p>
        <p>This was the specific details that was drawn on the new compensation plan.</p>
        <p>“What on earth do they have to increase taxes on our areas?”</p>
        <p>“Not to mention that Wěishàn’s villagers went to settle themselves in vicinity of the dam that was supposed to be destroyed. This was very selfish of them.”</p>
        <p>“Indeed! Moreover, it was a risky location, but still, they refused to move. HánGuāng-Jūn saved their lives by relocating them.”</p>
        <p>Over past few years, the residents of the lower reaches of Han River had been experiencing flooding. And each time it happened, they would turn to YúnmèngJiāng sect to get rid of ghouls after floods. And yet, none of them never received any compensation from the authorities.</p>
        <p>While these same authorities promised to compensate the Wěishàn’s villagers for their losses by increasing their taxes! This was unacceptable for those residents.</p>
        <p>Finally, the authorities broke the silence, and spoke about the Ganlin reservoir being originally built for flood control and water reservoir.</p>
        <p>With this reservoir in place, it would be easier to control the flood in the lower reaches of Han River, hence limiting the damages caused by inundations.</p>
        <p>Then, they talked about the relocation order being issued every year, and, finally, the villagers accepted to move out.</p>
        <p>And these two topics were the only ones the authorities communicated to those people.</p>
        <br />
        <p>... ... ...</p>
        <br />
        <p>As he landed and sheathed his sword, Lán XīChén said inwardly, “A-Yáo, you were right. People can behave very strangely, regarding of what rumour has been spreading. It is not funny at all.”</p>
        <p>Waving slightly his folding fan, and with a gentle smile on his face, Niè HuáiSāng greeted him, “XīChén-gē, you’re here.”</p>
