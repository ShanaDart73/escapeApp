            <p><b>Translator Note:</b></p>
            <p>Modaozushi (The Founder of Demonic Cultivation) is Mo Xiong Tong Xiu's masterpiece that has inspired many authors to write a side story, and, as a big fan of Modaozushi, this side story has caught my attention because Hua Guan Xiu Wei, the writer, has kept the same spirit of the original work.</p>
            <p>The original title of this story when translated in English doesn't make any sense at all, so I call it 'Lost of Oblivion' because, in this story, Wèi WúXiàn loses his happy memories spent with Lán WàngJī, yet, as oblivious as he was of his own feelings towards Lán WàngJī back when they were teenagers, this time, however, he becomes aware of it, and I find his awareness so cute that I decide to give the story this title.</p>
            <p>The author site: <a href="https://lanhuayishengpanjiegui.lofter.com/tag/%E5%BF%98%E7%BE%A1" target="_blank">花冠秀唯</a></p>

        <p>“Wèi qiánbèi*...” cried Yú XiǎoShān, overwhelming with remorse.</p>
        <small>*qiánbèi: a title addressed to someone older than oneself.</small>
        <p>Three hours ago, Yú XiǎoShān was assigned along with other teenagers to check the performance of the Requiem spell, which was cast on the Red Maple slope.</p>
        <p>Then, they would fly on their swords to patrol all the areas of the upper reaches of Han River.</p>
        <p>However, right now, Wèi WúXiàn spotted a pitch dark pond that they had overlooked. On close inspection, it was hard to determine the depth of the pond.</p>
        <p>At the centre, bubbles were constantly rising to the surface, like boiling water. However, when they actually touched the water, it felt icy-cold, like freezing water of a harsh winter.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled, and said, “Lán Zhàn, this promises to be interesting.”</p>
        <p>All teenagers understood that there was a need to investigate the pond. So, full of energy, the disciples of the YúnmèngJiāng sect* were already gearing up to dive in. Each of them wanted to show their swimming skills to the teenagers of the GūsūLán clan*.</p>
        <small>*‘sect’ term refers to all members of the sect, while ‘clan’ term refers to only blood-related members of the family that owns the sect.</small>
        <p>Yú XiǎoShān was the eldest grandson of the MéishānYú clan. Since he was a child, he had an outstanding spiritual power and extraordinary talent. Furthermore, he was highly praised when he was studying at Lotus Pier*.</p>
        <small>*Lotus Pier is the name of the residence of the YúnmèngJiāng sect.</small>
        <p>He was the first to put forward his proposal, he said, “Wèi qiánbèi, I am good at swimming. May I take the lead?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled, and said, “Okay. But you have to be careful. This pond is a little bit weird.”</p>
        <p>Yú XiǎoShān was young, lacking good judgement. The more he was told to be careful, the less he cared.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng*, I will dive with them because the water is too cold. However, Lán Yù and Lán Héng are not good at swimming. So, they will stay with you here, on the bank.”</p>
        <small>*Wèi Yīng: Yīng is the “first” name given from birth (same goes for Zhàn in Lán Zhàn), while WúXiàn and WàngJī are given later on.</small>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Okay.”</p>
        <p>To prevent them from freezing to death, each teenager wrapped their whole body with their spiritual power.</p>
        <p>Impatient to show off, Yú XiǎoShān went ahead and dived in.</p>
        <p>Fast and agile, Yú XiǎoShān was swimming like a fish. And, on his way down, he noticed that the water was undisturbed. He also observed some small fish swimming about, but he didn’t detect anything unusual.</p>
        <p>Yú XiǎoShān said to himself, “There is nothing special about this pond.” Then, he sped up his pace, and, soon after, he saw the bubbles streaming upwards, and decided to follow their source.</p>
        <p>At the bottom of the pond, Yú XiǎoShān found a stout and magnificent stone pillar. And, on the surface of the pillar, there was a huge spiral pattern.</p>
        <p>Following closely behind, Lán WàngJī also saw the stone pillar. He gestured at the rest of the teenagers to surround the pillar.</p>
        <p>Worried that the disciples of the GūsūLán clan would outstrip him, Yú XiǎoShān picked up speed towards the base of the stone pillar.</p>
        <p>However, upon reaching the bottom, his field of vision was blocked by a few long grey “ribbons”.</p>
        <p>Those “ribbons” were floating in front of Yú XiǎoShān, occasionally, tickling his face.</p>
        <p>Before Lán WàngJī could stop him, Yú XiǎoShān impulsively grabbed the “ribbons” and pulled them hard.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, a very big pair of eyes like two huge lanterns appeared in front of him.</p>
        <p>These enormous eyes were so bright that they illuminated the bottom of the pond, while being frightening at the same time.</p>
        <p>It turned out that the spiral pattern was in fact the body of a colossal beast. This creature had coiled itself upside down around the stone pillar. And, it was its beard that Yú XiǎoShān pulled, causing it to wake up from its sleep.</p>
        <p>And then, a very loud and furious roar stormed, sending strong vibrations, which almost damaged everyone’s eardrums.</p>
        <p>The roar of the beast caused the water of the pond to be in turmoil. And, this commotion struck fear into everyone's heart.</p>
        <p>Get out of water! Quick!</p>
        <p>Like having the devil at their heels, everyone at once began to swim upwards.</p>
        <p>One by one, Lán WàngJī led the teenagers to emerge from the water. And, for a while, there was a rush of the youngsters surfacing one after another.</p>
        <p>Once out of the water, each teenager summoned their sword, and flew to the bank.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the colossal beast kept on stirring the water, turning the centre of the pond into a huge vortex.</p>
        <p>Lán Qí, a teenager from GūsūLán clan, who had just stepped on his sword, but hadn’t the time to steady himself, was caught in the vortex.</p>
        <p>“Lán Qí!” cried out Wèi WúXiàn in terror.</p>
        <p>At that instant, a bright blue light swept in the air. Lán WàngJī was already next to Lán Qí, picked him up, and flew to the bank.</p>
        <p>Yú XiǎoShān, who had swum deeper than others, fell behind. As he surfaced and got on his sword, he felt a threatening presence behind him, and he couldn’t help but turn his head.</p>
        <p>He saw a camel-like head, two deer-like horns, a snake-like neck, eagle-like claws, and a body fully covered with carp-like scales. The best had an embedded pearl on its chin, a long grey beard, and some upward scales on its throat.</p>
        <p>He also observed a huge pair of golden eyes fiercely staring at him.</p>
        <p>It was a young dragon! A young dragon that would soon become a fully fledged dragon.</p>
        <p>The young dragon opened its dreadful mouth, and, like a tsunami, it launched itself towards Yú XiǎoShān.</p>
        <p>Yú XiǎoShān was helplessly looking at the young dragon that would soon devour him. He was so terrified that he could no longer move. His legs began to wobble, almost causing him to fall off from his sword.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, from the corner of his eye, he noticed a flash of red light. He didn’t have the time to react that, in the very next instant, he was thrust towards the bank by Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>To fly as fast as he could, Wèi WúXiàn used all his spiritual power. Now, he felt exhausted. Furthermore, since there was no more spiritual power left to feed his sword, Wèi WúXiàn could no longer make Suíbiàn* move.</p>
        <small>*Suíbiàn is the name of Wèi WúXiàn’s sword.</small>
        <p>The open mouth of the young dragon was getting closer, and, not only Wèi WúXiàn could see its sharp teeth and blood-red tongue, but also his field of vision was filled with its monstrous mouth.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn could even smell the stench of rotten meat reeking from its mouth; the smell of death.</p>
        <p>He thought to himself, “This is not the first time I am facing death.”</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng!”</p>
        <p>As soon as this well-known voice to him reached his ears, instantly, the owner of that voice occupied Wèi WúXiàn’s mind completely.</p>
        <p>His voice, which was always gentle and calm, now sounded like a white crane crying out in pain.</p>
        <p>To hear such a great distress in his voice hurt Wèi WúXiàn’s heart profoundly.</p>
        <p>Then, time seemed to stand still, and, although this vast world was populated, at that instant, the world became an empty place, except for only that person.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s heart began to beat rapidly. He then sensed a flow of spiritual power rushing through his veins.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn!” said to himself while clenching his fists tight, “Lán Zhàn is worried about me. I must not die!”</p>
        <p>He suddenly smiled.</p>
        <p>His smile was so bright that it eclipsed the sun.</p>
        <p>And, for a split second, it seemed to Lán WàngJī that he once more saw the invincible opponent in the battle of Jiānglíng, when thousands of Wēn sect’s cultivators had surrounded him However, none of them could get close to him.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was standing in the middle of the fierce* corpses, which were under his command. His untied hair was fluttering in the wind. And, the melodious sound of his flute was like played by a celestial being.</p>
        <small>*The term ‘fierce’ is used to describe a corpse with a strong resentment, hence the corpse is invincible.</small>
        <p>Back then, Wèi WúXiàn had the same smile on his face, arrogantly glancing at his opponents, looking down upon the world, everything was under his control.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn boldly said, “So what if you’ll soon turn into a fully fledged dragon. Who do you think you are to make Lán Zhàn feel so sad.”</p>
        <p>In an instant, there was a very warm sensation in his abdomen, then his whole body was filled with vigorous spiritual power.</p>
        <p>The red light of Suíbiàn became brighter, and, like a shooting star, Suíbiàn dashed towards the bank, covering several yards in the blink of an eye.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī, who had also rushed towards him, hugged Wèi WúXiàn in the air, holding him tight, he flew to the bank.</p>
        <p>The young dragon didn’t chase after them. It just hovered over the pond, quietly watching them, the mortal beings, while exhaling white fumes through its nostrils.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn stood side by side on the bank, fearlessly looking at the young dragon, and defiantly pointing their swords towards it.</p>
        <p>After a little while, it appeared as though the young dragon felt that fighting with those humans was beneath its dignity. It disdainfully wagged its tail, then flew away.</p>
        <p>As soon as the young dragon had gone, dark clouds began to appear in the sky. In the next instant, the sky was completely covered with the rolling gloomy clouds.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, lightning streaked through the clouds, soon followed by a loud sound of the thunder. And then, a heavy rain abruptly began to pour down.</p>
        <p>In no time, they were all drenched to the skin.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s wet fringe stuck on his forehead, while rainwater was sliding down his cheeks.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn.” he called, turning his head towards Lán WàngJī, and was instantly shocked to see the white parts of Lán WàngJī’s eyes had turned red. It was a terrible sight.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn’s heart was in pain. He then smiled, and said; “I was really scared. So, hurry up and soothe m––”</p>
        <p>He hadn’t even finished his sentence that Lán WàngJī abruptly pulled him into his arms, and covered his mouth in a deep kiss.</p>
        <p>The sandalwood fragrance of Lán WàngJī also wrapped around Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was so fervently kissed that he felt his whole body becoming feeble. Furthermore, Lán WàngJī was holding him so tight that his upper body began to hurt.</p>
        <p>Putting his hands against Lán WàngJī’s chest, Wèi WúXiàn tried his best to break free. Then, gasping for breath, he said, “Wait! We are in front of kids...”</p>
        <p>Paying no heed to Wèi WúXiàn’s attempt, Lán WàngJī put one hand on the back of Wèi WúXiàn’s head, and vigorously pulled him back into his arms, while his other hand clapped on Wèi WúXiàn’s buttocks firmly, he turned around.</p>
        <p>With his back, Lán WàngJī put Wèi WúXiàn out of sight of the teenagers, who were so shocked that their jaws dropped open.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn moaned in pain. However, this time, he didn’t dare to struggle. Instead, he submissively wrapped his arms around Lán WàngJī’s neck, and let him give vent to his distress.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī’s kisses were like a tornado, causing havoc wherever it passed. Biting Wèi WúXiàn’s lower lip as though he wanted to tear it off. Sucking his tongue to the point that Wèi WúXiàn began to feel the base of his tongue going numb.</p>
        <p>Gradually, Wèi WúXiàn was getting close to losing his consciousness. His arms began to slide down from Lán WàngJī’s neck. And, before he could pass out, Lán WàngJī finally let go of his mouth.</p>
        <p>Still holding Wèi WúXiàn tight, Lán WàngJī let him rest his head on his chest, while turning his own head, and quietly looking at the teenagers. His ears became red with embarrassment.</p>
        <p>At the moment they saw Lán WàngJī turning his head towards them, some YúnmèngJiāng sect’s disciples hurriedly turned around to avoid eye contact. Lán SīZhuī blindfolded Lán JǐngYí with his hands, while closing his own eyes tight.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn pressed his forehead against Lán WàngJī’s chin, wrapped his arms around him, and gave him a few pats on the back to comfort him.</p>
        <p>They peacefully hugged each other for a while.</p>
        <p>Then, Wèi WúXiàn slightly raised his head, and pecked Lán WàngJī on the cheek. He tenderly said, “Lán Zhàn, I formed a golden core*.”</p>
        <small>*Golden core is the source of the spiritual energy.</small>

            <p>“Lán Zhàn, this is not a normal rain.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
            <p>“Uh-huh.” agreed Lán WàngJī. He then looked far into the distance, observing the endless dark clouds that covered the whole city, the torrential rain that poured like hell, and the strong wind that roared like a tiger.</p>
            <p>Soon after, a firework signal in the shape of nine petals of the lotus flower flickered in the air. This firework signal belonged to YúnmèngJiāng sect.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Someone from YúnmèngJiāng clan will come this way. Let’s wait here for whoever will arrive, so, together, we can discuss what to do next.”</p>
            <p>The area in which they were presently was the region of Yúnmèng, a territory that was under the jurisdiction of the YúnmèngJiāng sect. Therefore, they could not handle this rain issue without their permission.</p>
            <p>After a while, a cultivator dressed in purple arrived on his sword, looking exhausted; a sign that indicated that something must have happened. His name was Jiāng Yuán, and was stationed at the local post tower.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn was inwardly surprised that there was a post tower of Lotus Piers nearby.</p>
            <p>Jiāng Yuán bowed to Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn, then said, “This rainstorm is so violent that it has caused flash floods in many places in the downstream areas of Han River.</p>
            <p>“Furthermore, water ghouls have taken advantage of the flooding to attack people.</p>
            <p>“The leader has already sent our people to every embankment’s location, so to protect them from bursting under pressure of water.</p>
            <p>“Right now, however, there is a shortage of manpower, so the leader has dispatched a request for assistance to LánlíngJīn, GūsūLán and QīnghéNiè clans.”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn inwardly said, “Jiāng Chéng* has always been arrogant and aloof. For him to swallow his pride and ask for help to other clans surely shows that the situation must be extremely serious, that lives of common people are at stake.”</p>
            <small>*Jiāng Chéng is the name of the leader of the YúnmèngJiāng sect.</small>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Where is Leader Jiāng as we speak?”</p>
            <p>Jiāng Yuán replied, “The leader is in charge of protecting the Shiyan embankment.”</p>
            <p>The embankment of Shiyan was built where the width of Han River was the most narrow, and also it was mostly likely to be damaged by the floods. Since Jiāng Chéng was personally supervising the operation there, this was another sign that the situation of the lower reaches of Han River must be critical.</p>
            <p>During all this time, eyes filled with tears, Yú XiǎoShān was inwardly blaming himself, unable to utter a single word.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn, who was briefly informed of what happened in the pond, patted him on the shoulder, and said, “In the recent years, there has been many floods occurring in Yúnmèng. Now, it’s clear that they were caused by that young dragon.</p>
            <p>“It has also altered the spiritual energy of the earth and water, causing the monsters and evil spirits to appear more frequently.</p>
            <p>“But now that the young dragon has gone, this heavy rain won’t last more than three days, and all these issues will be resolved at once. There might be a favourable weather for a decade to come.”</p>
            <p>Yú XiǎoShān was still young after all, and could no longer hold back his tears. He started to cry. Then, he felt embarrassed, and wiped away his tears. While choking back the tears, he called  “Wèi qiánbèi...”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn smiled, then adjusted the collar of Yú XiǎoShān’s school uniform, and said, “It’s all right. Who has ever done a few reckless things when they were young. I was much more of a fool than you back then. Cheer up!”</p>
            <p>The other teenagers from YúnmèngJiāng sect gathered around Wèi WúXiàn, then, in a low voice and in a discordant manner, they called, “Wèi qiánbèi.”</p>
            <p>One by one, Wèi WúXiàn fondled the top of their heads. Then, he addressed to everyone, “Right now, we cannot any longer return to Lotus Piers by boat.</p>
            <p>“Since this place is where the young dragon cultivated itself, SīZhuī and JǐngYí, both of you will stay here along with the rest of GūsūLán disciples, in case something else happens.</p>
            <p>“As for the disciples of YúnmèngJiāng sect, who are more familiar with this area, come along with us. HánGuāng-Jūn* and I are going to Shiyan embankment to join Leader Jiāng. On our way there, we will fly over Han River in order to inspect the level of the river.”</p>
            <small>*HánGuāng-Jūn is the honorific title of Lán WàngJī.</small>
            <p>“Yes, sir!” agreed everyone.</p>
            <br />
            <p>... ... ...</p>
            <br />
            <p>Lán WàngJī had taken Wèi WúXiàn to ride on his sword.</p>
            <p>Wrapping his arms around Lán WàngJī’s waist, and while fiddling with Lán WàngJī’s waist pendant, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Second Brother*, you will be tired. Let me ride on my own sword.”</p>
            <small>*Second Brother (二哥哥, èr gēgē) is referred to the second child of a family.</small>
            <p>Lán WàngJī said, “You just formed your golden core. So, for the time being, you should not use your spiritual power.”</p>
            <p>He then held Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, and added, “When we arrive at Shiyan embankment, you’ll need to meditate in order to stabilise your golden core.”</p>
            <p>Flying through the strong storm that caused them to move much slower than usual, they all had wrapped their whole bodies with a waterproof spell.</p>
            <p>Beneath, the river was raging; they could observe a sharp increase in the level of water, and also, in many places, the river had already overflown the embankments.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, Lán WàngJī stopped Bìchén*. Pointing towards a location, he asked, “What is that?”</p>
            <small>*Bìchén is the name of Lán WàngJī’s sword.</small>
            <p>Everyone looked in the direction he had pointed his finger, and saw a huge hole on the ground that was surrounded by a woodland with an abundant vegetation.</p>
            <p>Jiāng Yuán replied, “That is Ganlin Reservoir. It was built under the reign of the previous dynasty. It is now abandoned.</p>
            <p>“In the last years of the previous dynasty, the downstream areas of Han River were occupied by the army of the current dynasty.</p>
            <p>“In order to crush the enemy, the emperor of the previous dynasty personally order to construct a dam, so that when the flood happened, the overflow of water would be stored in that reservoir, and, later on, to be released in order to inundate the downstream areas.</p>
            <p>“In the year the dam was built, there was a high flood peak. However, when the flood occurred, water failed to go towards Ganlin Reservoir. Instead, it diverted to Ankang River.</p>
            <p>“Ankang City is nearby, and the width of its river is unfortunately much narrow, and, as a result, the Ankang embankment burst under pressure, and the city was flooded.</p>
            <p>“The flood had caused a lot of casualties in the downstream areas of Ankang River, which in turn had caused common people to harbour a grievance against their own emperor.</p>
            <p>“Few years after that incident, the previous dynasty was exterminated by the current dynasty.”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Is it be possible to divert the overflow of water to that reservoir, if we blow up the dam?”</p>
            <p>Jiāng Yuán replied, “Yes, it is possible. However, at the end of the previous dynasty, people started to live near the reservoir.</p>
            <p>“As you can see, this area is fertile, and the crop yields are high. So, more and more people have come here to settle. And, up to the present time, that area turns into a village of about a hundred households.</p>
            <p>“If the dam is blown up, the village will be submerged.</p>
            <p>“In fact, people are not supposed to live in that location. Although the imperial officials came multiple times to persuade them to move out, the villagers are reluctant to leave the land they are attached to.</p>
            <p>“The leader also came to persuade them, but they still haven’t changed their mind.</p>
            <p>“In recent years, there have been some minor floods occurring in their village, but nothing serious has ever happened. So, year after year, their relocation process has been put off.”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “The young dragon that had concealed itself inside the pond has caused changes in the weather conditions. That’s why we have this unusual heavy rain.</p>
            <p>“So, this time, the disaster will happen and very soon. Those villagers must leave the village without delay.</p>
            <p>“If you have the decree of your sect with you, go and ask the imperial officials to come to the village. We’ll wait for you there.”</p>
            <p>Then, he talked to Lán WàngJī, “Lán Zhàn, let’s go to the village.”</p>
            <p>“Okay.” agreed Lán WàngJī, then he set Bìchén in motion and flew towards the village, along with the rest of YúnmèngJiāng disciples.</p>
            <br />
            <p>... ... ...</p>
            <br />
            <p>Wěishàn was the name of the village, and the negotiation began as soon as the imperial officials arrived.</p>
            <p>“HánGuāng-Jūn, even though you are highly regarded in the elite society, you should not trouble yourself with our mundane matters.</p>
            <p>“We have been living in this village for four or five generations. Are you really expecting us to move out just because you told us to do so?” said the village chief arrogantly, banging his walking stick on the floor as he uttered his last words.</p>
            <p>“No way!” objected the rest of the villagers.</p>
            <p>“We can’t just leave, and abandon our homes.” voiced a villager.</p>
            <p>The drill instructor in charge of the relocation process stepped in, “Every year, in spring, the prefect issues a relocation order for you to move out.</p>
            <p>“This year, because the warlock predicted changes in meteorological phenomena, the prefect has issued three consecutive emergency orders. And yet, you still refuse to be relocated.</p>
            <p>“You are living in a land which is lower than the level of the river. Are you not afraid?</p>
            <p>“I know that you have already packed your belongings, but you refuse to cooperate, unless someone gets tough on you. Am I right?”</p>
            <p>After a short pause, the drill instructor resumed, “The compensation has already been assessed. Right now, you are taking the advantage of this emergency to increase the amount of the compensation.”</p>
            <p>Persuading those people to move out from their village had always been a hassle. Upon seeing the decree of the YúnmèngJiāng sect, the authorities had mobilised nearly a hundred officials to assist in relocating the villagers.</p>
            <p>Lán WàngJī reiterated, “As I have already said, I promise you that GūsūLán will pay for your looses, if the authorities fail to compensate you in time.”</p>
            <p>The village chief reacted, “I don’t believe in your promise, because you people from the privileged sects are the most deceitful mankind. When the time comes, neither your sect nor the authorities will easily accept to compensate us.”</p>
            <p>Another villager put forward, “We have never experienced any disaster despite the heavy rains that pour down every year. So, we won’t leave!”</p>
            <p>Then, one after another, the villagers started to raise their voice, behaving as though the imminent threat was none of their concern.</p>
            <p>Time was running out, and, standing behind Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn could not take it any longer. He approached the drill instructor, and, in deep voice, he asked, “Mr Zhāng, is it true that the compensation has already been assessed?”</p>
            <p>The drill instructor replied, “Yes, it’s true. The village chief saw it, and sighed it. However, the nine members of the village committee have not signed it yet.”</p>
            <p>He then took out a stack of copies from his sleeve, and handed it over to Lán WàngJī. He added, “As a matter of fact, the villagers are ready to be relocated. They are just waiting for the compensation to be paid.”</p>
            <p>For a while, the drill instructor cast a look at the villagers, then he said, “Earlier, when I inspected the village, I noticed that you have already packed your belongings.”</p>
            <p>The villagers appeared to be indifferent to what the drill instructor had just said, wearing a disdainful look on their faces.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Very well.”</p>
            <p>He then pulled off Chénqíng* from his waist belt, and carelessly began to tap on the palm of his another hand with his flute.</p>
            <small>*Chénqíng is the name of Wèi WúXiàn’s flute.</small>
            <p>A rictus appeared on the corner of his mouth, he asked, “By the way, have you ever heard of Yílíng Lǎozǔ*?”</p>
            <small>*Yílíng Lǎozǔ is the honorific title of Wèi WúXiàn.</small>
            <p>The village chief suddenly turned pale, saying inwardly, “Rumour has it that Yílíng Lǎozǔ and HánGuāng-Jūn got married, and become an inseparable couple. Could it be that this handsome young man is Yílíng Lǎozǔ?”</p>
            <p>These villagers had never seen Yílíng Lǎozǔ. However, they had heard about his prowess during the Shooting Sun campaign, his hostility on Qióngqí Path and his atrocities at Nightless Sky City. They all had shuddered with horror listening to the vicious methods of Yílíng Lǎozǔ.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn slowly turned his flute so that everyone could see the scarlet tassel that was dangling from one end of Chénqíng; the scarlet tassel was one of  Yílíng Lǎozǔ’s signatures.</p>
            <p>He then smiled, and said, “I am Yílíng Lǎozǔ, also known as Wèi WúXiàn.”</p>
            <p>As soon as he finished presenting himself, Wèi WúXiàn brought Chénqíng to his lower lip, and, at leisure, he blew a few notes.</p>
            <p>All of a sudden, they started to hear some terrifying roars coming from outside. It seemed like the assembly hall was surrounded by fierce corpses.</p>
            <p>As one would expect, the villagers got really frightened that they were no longer able to make noises.</p>
            <p>Still, it was hard to believe that the vicious Yílíng Lǎozǔ was this fair-skinned and elegant young man.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
            <p>So as to convince whoever might doubt that he was Yílíng Lǎozǔ, Wèi WúXiàn walked to the front of the hall, and slowly sat down on one of the main chairs.</p>
            <p>He then snapped his fingers, and, the very next instant, the villagers gasped in horror; a long-haired and faceless female demon in red appeared next to Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
            <p>Using his flute, Wèi WúXiàn began to stir up the demon’s hair, which had an effect of stimulating the demon’s hostility. The sight of the faceless demon became extremely frightening.</p>
            <p>Casting a sideways glance at the villagers, and in a gentle tone, yet, a tone full of threats, Wèi WúXiàn said, “I’ve run out of patience. You have until before the nightfall to leave the village. Whoever stays beyond that limit will be turned into a fierce corpse.”</p>
            <p>The terrifying Yílíng Lǎozǔ, who showed no sympathy to anyone, who just by mentioning his name made children stop crying at night, instantly made those reluctant villagers get going.</p>
            <p>There were nearly a hundred officers sent in order to assist in relocation of the villagers, and those officers brought along many horses and carts. Moreover, there were enough young adults in the village to give a hand. So, the evacuation would not be a major problem.</p>
            <p>“Mr Zhāng, now it’s down to you and your men to deal with the relocation.” said Wèi WúXiàn, “HánGuāng-Jūn and I are going to blow up the dam.”</p>
            <p>The drill instructor repeatedly said ‘yes’, while being on his guard. Apparently, the villagers were not the only ones being scared by Yílíng Lǎozǔ.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn was used to that kind of reaction. He humbly smiled to himself. What he wanted to do right now was to leave as soon as possible along with Lán WàngJī.</p>
            <p>However, at that precise moment, someone among the last few of the villagers to leave the hall suddenly stepped forward, and rudely said, “Wèi WúXiàn, you evil heretic! You’re still as insolent as ever!”</p>
            <p>That person turned out to be Fāng MèngChén*. Furthermore, this village was not only his grandmother’s homeland, but also the place where he had been living in seclusion.</p>
            <small>*Fāng MèngChén lost his parents during the Nightless Sky City bloodbath. When he got the chance to avenge their deaths, a turn of events happened, and he was instead saved by Wèi WúXiàn.</small>
            <p>“HánGuāng-Jūn, Wèi WúXiàn’s evil nature has not changed. And yet, you condone his villainy.” carried on Fāng MèngChén in a resentful way.</p>
            <p>Once there is a feeling of hatred in someone’s heart, lies and slanders are bound to be spread around, and people love to listen to the incredible and sensational rumours. Why should one bother about it? The truth never gets people excited, so it is easily ignored.</p>
            <p>The drill instructor did not at all intervene. Relocating a village, no matter how much the compensation was provided, always caused villagers to hold grudges against the authorities.</p>
            <p>Over the past ten years, three local prefects had taken office one after another. However, none of them had ever dared to tackle this relocation issue.</p>
            <p>Every time something happened that required to relocate them, if the villagers insisted on staying, the authorities had no other alternative but to give up.</p>
            <p>Now that Yílíng Lǎozǔ took on this burdensome task, the authorities had surely taken this advantage to get rid of this relocation process. However, the drill instructor didn’t go into that detail when he explained the matter to Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
            <p>Outside, the torrential rain kept on pouring. And, right now, it was a race against time to get all the villagers out of the village before the nightfall.</p>
            <p>The early yelling of the villagers had caused Wèi WúXiàn’s head to spin. He knew that there were people who had their own mindset, and trying to reason with them would be just a waste of time. Therefore, he didn’t feel like justifying himself.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn made a gesture to stop Lán WàngJī who was about to intervene, and simply said, “You knew straight away what kind of villain I am. So, why are you still here?”</p>
            <p>He then unsheathed Suíbiàn, pointed the sword towards Fāng MèngChén, and asked, “Can you beat me?” Fāng MèngChén immediately froze in fear. Then, he added, “ If you can’t, then shut up, and go help others to move out.”</p>
            <p>Fāng MèngChén’s face was filled with indignation. He then pointed his finger at Wèi WúXiàn, “You..., you...”</p>
            <p>The faceless demon turned its head, and “looked” at Fāng MèngChén, as though she was threatening him.</p>
            <p>As a result, Fāng MèngChén was no longer able to utter whatever the verbal abuse he was about to. He lifted his robes, walked towards the exit, and slammed the door as he left the hall.</p>
            <p>Still holding Chénqíng in his hand, Wèi WúXiàn waved at the female demon, and the latter disappeared. He hen thundered at the rest of villagers, “Why are you still here! Come on, get moving!”</p>
            <p>The villagers immediately dispersed, returning to their homes to get ready to leave the village.</p>
            <p>Then, the drill instructor saluted Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn with his hands brought in of him, making one into a fist while the other covered the fist. He then left the assembly hall with his men.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn sent Jiāng Yuán along with the rest of the YúnmèngJiāng disciples to assist the villagers with their relocation.</p>
            <p>Right now, the only people remained inside the hall were Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
            <p>“Wèi Yīng...” Lán WàngJī held Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, feeling extremely frustrated for not being able to defend him. He wanted to say something, but he felt that his words would not convey his feelings. Besides, he knew that he was not good at expressing himself.</p>
            <p>Seeing that his sweetheart was longing to say something but unable to utter a single word, Wèi WúXiàn put an end to his struggle by placing Chénqíng over Lán WàngJī’s lips.</p>
            <p>He then said, while smiling, “HánGuāng-Jūn, you’re such an angel. You always stand by my side. Cheer up! Don’t be so sad. I don’t care what other people think of me. I only care about you, and how you see me.”</p>
            <p>He wrapped his arms around Lán WàngJī’s waist. His gaze became flirtatious, and his voice coquettish, “So, keep on pampering me, and never leave me.”</p>
            <p>He then stood on tiptoe, leaned close to Lán WàngJī’s white jade colour-like ear, softly blew into the ear, and said, “You are mine.”</p>
            <p>As soon as he heard those words, Lán WàngJī held Wèi WúXiàn tight into his arms, and earnestly said, “You are mine, too.”</p>
            <p>What is right and what is wrong are judged by oneself. One’s reputation is judged by others. One’s gains and losses are at the mercy of their quantity.</p>
            <p>For Lán WàngJī, his Wèi Yīng was still the same, despite many hardships he had gone through.</p>
            <br />
            <p>... ... ...</p>
            <br />
            <p>Located ten miles away from Wěishàn Village, the dam stood tall and majestic, on the top, five carts could drive abreast, and its outer walls were coated with iron, making the dam very resistant and solid.</p>
            <p>Spiritual powers were primarily used to slay evil spirits, demons and monsters. Since all things in this world had their own laws and principles, cultivators’ powers turned out to be very limited in dealing with the mundane things.</p>
            <p>So, destroying this robust dam in a very short period of time, even for someone with high spiritual power like Lán WàngJī, would take a lot of efforts to succeed.</p>
            <p>In the pouring rain, Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn carefully selected the appropriate positions for the detonation. Then, they wrapped each blasting talisman with a waterproof spell, and then, placed them on the selected positions.</p>
            <p>The blasting talismans were emitting a clear blue light through the rain. However, from a distance, the emitted blue light grew dimmer.</p>
            <p>Those talismans, however, would be activated only after all villagers had reached the main road, which was located near the mountains. Then, Lán WàngJī would use his spiritual power to strike on the holes that would be made with the blasting talismans.</p>
            <p>The night would fall in less than two hours. Meanwhile, Lán WàngJī gave Wèi WúXiàn some assorted rice balls, and regretfully said, “I didn’t bring enough food to eat, because I didn’t expect this turn of events.”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn leaned his head on Lán WàngJī’s shoulder. Licking his fingers after he had eaten a rice ball, he said, “Second Brother, it was delicious. What did you put inside? Was it a plum? It was soft with a little bit of the sour taste. You’re so wonderful.”</p>
            <p>Lán WàngJī’s lips curved into a smile. He wrapped one arm around Wèi WúXiàn’s waist, and put the palm of his other hand on Wèi WúXiàn’s abdomen, where the lower Dantian was located. He could feel the undulation of the spiritual power, which was much different than before.</p>
            <p>He said, “Wèi Yīng, you formed your golden core just few hours ago, so, you should get some rest. ”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “I’ll sleep for a while, then. Wake me up when Jiāng Yuán sends us a message.”</p>
            <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Okay.” Then, sitting on a rock, he extended the layer of his waterproof spell, and then, he carried Wèi WúXiàn on his lap, letting him rest on his arms.</p>
            <p>The heavy rain was pouring like a towering waterfall, under the dark and gloomy clouds, the blue sky was high and out of sight. However, they cared less about this dreadful weather, since they had each other, and nothing else mattered to them.</p>
            <p>With the exception of the rainstorm and river sounds, everything was completely silent. It seemed as though they were the only ones left in this vast world.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn formed his golden core at a critical moment. Then, for half a day, he had been rushing around, which made his golden core’s vessel become unstable. Right now, he felt extremely tired, he closed his eyes, and, in a low voice, he said, “Lán Zhàn, sing a song to lull me to sleep.”</p>
            <p>Lán WàngJī tenderly kissed Wèi WúXiàn on the forehead, then he softly began to hum WàngXiàn, a song that he composed for both of them. Soon after, Wèi WúXiàn fell into a deep sleep.</p>
            <br />
            <p>... ... ...</p>
            <br />
            <p>“Wèi Yīng... Wèi Yīng... wake up.”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn woke up from his sleep as he heard Lán WàngJī’s voice calling him. He somehow felt that he didn’t rest long enough. As was his habit, each time Lán WàngJī woke him up, Wèi WúXiàn would hug him and peck him on the cheek four or five times.</p>
            <p>With his fingers, Lán WàngJī gently combed Wèi WúXiàn’s long hair, then, he adjusted his ponytail, and said, “Jiāng Yuán sent the message saying that they all have reached the main road.”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Let’s begin, then.”</p>
            <p>In the torrential rain, Lán WàngJī summoned WàngJī*, while Wèi WúXiàn invoked spirits. Then, together, they activated all the blasting talismans.</p>
            <small>*The guqin of Lán WàngJī is named after his owner: WàngJī.</small>
            <p>The sound of the detonation roared loudly, several large holes could be seen at the bottom of the dam. However, the dam was too solid, the blasting talismans couldn’t blow through its walls.</p>
            <p>Using his guqin, Lán WàngJī began to strike with all his strength, sending WàngJī’s ice-blue spiritual notes at the bottom of the dam, and, little by little, expanding and deepening the holes that were previously made with the blasting talismans.</p>
            <p>As Lán WàngJī continued to consume his spiritual power, Wèi WúXiàn felt uneasy watching him exhausting himself.</p>
            <p>He said, “Lán Zhàn, this won’t do. I will go to Ankang River and find where the width of the river is the most narrow, then build a barrier with fierce corpses.</p>
            <p>“When the current won’t any longer carry on downstream, it will flow back and diverge here. You will then gather the force of that current to destroy the dam. ”</p>
            <p>Lán WàngJī immediately said, “No! You are not going anywhere, because your golden core is still fragile.” He then realised that the tone of his voice was a little bit harsh, and, inwardly, he regretted it.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn reassured him, “Don’t worry, I won’t use too much of my spiritual power. I will mostly use my demonic power.”</p>
            <p>He then took out from his sleeve two signal-transfer talismans. He stuck one on Lán WàngJī’s chest, and stuck the other within his clothes, at his chest level.</p>
            <p>He said, “If you succeed in blowing up the dam, use this signal-transfer talisman to let me know. Once, I receive the signal, I’ll come back here straight away.”</p>
            <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you must be careful, don’t do anything reckless. If you start to feel poorly, notify me immediately.”</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn summoned Suíbiàn, then stepped on it. He leaned forward and kissed Lán WàngJī, he then said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, I’m afraid that we won’t have time to make love tonight. Since that will be the case, remember to make it up to me next time.”</p>
    </div>

    <div>
            <p>First of all, Wèi WúXiàn flew back to Wěishàn Village, and observed that it was completely empty, not even a single farm animal was left behind.</p>
            <p>Like the drill instructor mentioned earlier that the villagers had already packed their belongings, which, fortunately, made the evacuation to be done much faster.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn then proceeded on what brought him here by blowing on Chénqíng so as to summon a large numbers of fierce corpses from the graveyard of the village.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, he began to hear some cries, which were undoubtedly made by a baby.</p>
            <p>Guided by the cries, Wèi WúXiàn found a baby girl, around three months old, inside of one of the empty houses.</p>
            <p>Favouring boys over girls was the only reason that came into Wèi WúXiàn’s mind to explain why the parents of this baby heartlessly abandon their own daughter.</p>
            <p>On a table, Wèi WúXiàn noticed a jar of milk, and, by the smell, he determined that it was from a sheep. Leaving this milk was probably the parents’ wish to ease the soul of the baby after death.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn found it rather ironic to care for the soul of the baby rather than the baby herself, letting out a heavy sigh of despair.</p>
            <p>He then took a sip of sheep milk in order to ensure its freshness, and quickly warmed it up with his spiritual power. Using a wooden spoon, also found on the table, he began to feed the baby.</p>
            <p>However, not only the little baby girl was not familiar with Wèi WúXiàn’s scent, but also she was neither accustomed to the taste of sheep milk, nor was she used to be fed with a spoon. All of this caused her to cry even louder, wanting to be held and breastfed by her mother.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn tried to soothe the crying baby, first by swinging side to side while holding her, then by gently stroking her back, and then by humming some nursery rhymes. However, none of these methods worked.</p>
            <p>In the end, the baby got really hungry that she finally let Wèi WúXiàn feed her.</p>
            <p>When he was a teenager, Wèi WúXiàn had taken care of his juniors of around six years old. However, he had never looked after a baby before.</p>
            <p>So, for fear that he would choke the little baby, Wèi WúXiàn took extra care to fed her. And, after he finished spoon-feeding her, the baby, tired from crying so much, fell deeply asleep.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn then became concerned with the amount of time that took him to deal with the baby.</p>
            <p>Without further delay, he took the baby’s blanket and wrapped the little baby, then, holding the baby, he secured the blanket firmly around his torso like a baby wrap carrier, and was ready to go. </p>
            <p>Before leaving the house, Wèi WúXiàn put back the waterproof spell that he had removed when he entered into the house, then he flew towards Ankang River, giving orders to the fierce corpses to follow along.</p>
            <p>Remembering what Jiāng Yuán said about the Ankang embankment, which was burst by the flood under the reign of the previous dynasty, Wèi WúXiàn intended to build the barrier of fierce corpses at that precise location.</p>
            <p>If his assumption was correct, the embankment must have been built where the width of the river was the most narrow, which was what he wanted.</p>
            <p>The night had fallen in this dreadful rain, so, Wèi WúXiàn took out few fire-talismans from his sleeve, and ignited them so as to light his way to Ankang River.</p>
            <p>Also illuminated by the talismans, Han River beneath was still turbulent, and the level of the water kept on increasing.</p>
            <p>Upon reaching Ankang River, Wèi WúXiàn easily spotted the location of his interest, since the embankment had never been repaired, and, furthermore, at that spot, the current ran much faster.</p>
            <p>He pulled off Chénqíng, brought it to his lips, but, all the sudden, he paused, appeared to have forgotten something.</p>
            <p>He put his flute back on his waist belt, unshielded Suíbiàn, and cut two small and clean pieces of his gown, then, carefully, he plugged the baby’s ears with the two pieces of cloth.</p>
            <p>The little baby was still sleeping soundly, putting her tiny little hands on Wèi WúXiàn’s chest.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn noticed it, and the whole scene brought a warm smile on his face.</p>
            <p>He then prodded her gently on the cheek, and said, “Young girl, wait that I finish my work here, then I will take you to see my HánGuāng-Jūn. He is the most handsome man in the world. You’re definitely going to like him.”</p>
            <p>Then, he pulled off Chénqíng, and began to blow some notes. In response to the sound of the flute, the fierce corpses from Wěishàn Village’s graveyard jumped into the river.</p>
            <p>From the riverbed and across the river, a tall wall of fierce corpses was formed, then, countless of water ghouls emerged from water, and scrambled up to fill the gaps between fierce corpses.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn intensified the sound of his flute, which cut through the darkness of the night, spread across the surroundings, and resounded through the sky.</p>
            <p>Soon after, more water ghouls came over, and quickly placed themselves on the remnants of the embankment so as to rebuild a new one.</p>
            <p>Ever since Wèi WúXiàn had returned from death, this was the first time he used his demonic power on such a large scale.</p>
            <p>In this heavy rain, the barrier of fierce corpses and water ghouls was completed, and the Ankang embankment was temporarily repaired with water ghouls. </p>
            <p>The downstream flow of water progressively dropped, while, on the other side of the barrier, the coming waves hit violently the newly erected barrier.</p>
            <p>At this rate, the barrier would not withstand the pressure much longer, so, Wèi WúXiàn summoned more corpses from far to reinforce the barrier.</p>
            <p>However, it was not an easy task to overcome the force of nature, even for Yílíng Lǎozǔ, the founder of demonic cultivation.</p>
            <p>At that instance, he felt a violent swing in his golden core vessel, immediately followed by a sharp pain as though his abdomen was ripped open.</p>
            <p>“Oh gosh!” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, “I haven’t had the time to reconcile my newly formed golden core with my demonic power. Right now, the two opposite powers are clashing with each other.”</p>
            <p>Ever since he had been living with Lán WàngJī, Wèi WúXiàn had rarely used his demonic power.</p>
            <p>However, right now, not only he overused it, but also the existence of the freshly formed golden core made the situation to be more alarming. So, Wèi WúXiàn didn’t dare to be reckless. Besides, he had promised Lán WàngJī that he would be careful.</p>
            <p>The last thing to be done was to use talismans to stabilise the barrier that he had just finished building, then, with the baby girl, he would rejoin Lán WàngJī.</p>
            <p>However, all the remains of talismans in his possession were all marked with ‘blasting’ character on them; no more blank talismans left to be used for the barrier.</p>
            <p>This inconvenience, however, didn’t stop him from carrying out his last task. He stepped on Suíbiàn, then got close to the barrier, and, up there, he cut his fingers with his sword, and then, using his blood, Wèi WúXiàn began to draw a series of characters on the barrier.</p>
            <p>After he had finished marking the whole barrier, a bright red light shone from it like a wildfire blazing across the woods.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, however, the pain in his golden core vessel had progressively increased. Now, it became unbearable.</p>
            <p>“It’s done.” said to himself. Then, all of a sudden, he got dizzy, and, with the extreme pain in his abdomen, he was no longer able to stand on his sword, and fell on his butt along with his sword on the riverbed presently exhibited.</p>
            <p>Using Suíbiàn as a support, and not allowing the silt to dirty the baby’s blanket, Wèi WúXiàn managed to stand up.</p>
            <p>Then, he said, “This dizziness is caused by my using too much blood. I’m afraid that this time I have to drink the GūsūLán bitter decoction without complaint.”</p>
            <p>At that precise moment, he felt a murderous aura, and, since he had been on the battlefields, facing death countless times, instinctively, Wèi WúXiàn dodged while protecting the baby.</p>
            <p>The very next instant of him avoiding the unknown danger, a flash of energy of a sword whizzed past him.</p>
            <p>A corner of his sleeve was torn off by the energy of that sword. Furthermore, the ripped cloth was sliced into small pieces, flew a few yards away, and landed scattered on the mud of the riverbed.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn then turned his head towards where the attack came from, and, to his astonishment, he saw Fāng MèngChén.</p>
            <p>Fāng MèngChén had left Wěishàn Village along with the rest of the villagers. However, soon after they had reached the main road, a quarrel broke out between the villagers and the youngsters of the YúnmèngJiāng sect.</p>
            <p>Soon, the scene became chaotic, and, taking advantage of the conflict, Fāng MèngChén sneaked away with his sword, and flew back to the village. Just as he approached the village, he saw Wèi WúXiàn, who carried a baby, flew towards Ankang City, followed by fierce corpses.</p>
            <p>“So, it’s you, who furtively attacked me.” said Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
            <p>“Yes, it’s me. Are you surprised to see me?” uttered Fāng MèngChén with a face full of hatred. “I’m here to put an end to your despicable existence.” he added.</p>
            <p>After secretly following Wèi WúXiàn, Fāng MèngChén had hidden himself inside the dense woods on one side of the river, waiting for Wèi WúXiàn to exhaust himself, as well as using up all his spiritual power.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately for Wèi WúXiàn, there were no more corpses or water ghouls in a radius of several miles that he could summon to fight against Fāng MèngChén.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, he could not afford to break the spell of the talismans, and use the fierce corpses that were holding the water of the river back, or use the ghouls that formed the embankment as a flood prevention.</p>
            <p>So, bearing the severe pain in his abdomen, Wèi WúXiàn held Suíbiàn on one hand, and shielded the baby with the other hand, he fought and exchanged several attacks with Fāng MèngChén.</p>
            <p>For some time, they attacked each other with their spiritual powers without interruption.</p>
            <p>Then, as it was advisable for him not to use too much of his spiritual power, came an acute sensation from his abdomen. At that instance, Wèi WúXiàn sensed that some cracks were formed in his golden core, similar to those in a crystal ball.</p>
            <p>Trying hard to stand firm on his feet while concealing any flaws, Wèi WúXiàn said, “You are here to avenge the death of your parents, however, your revenge has nothing to do with this baby. So, let me put her on the riverbank.” </p>
            <p>Fāng MèngChén snorted, and said sharply, “Why should I spare the life of your evil child?”</p>
            <p>Irritated, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Are you mad? This baby is not my child.”</p>
            <p>Being as stubborn as a mule, Fāng MèngChén uttered, “If the child is not yours, then why are you protecting her?” As he spoke, Fāng MèngChén gathered a great amount of energy that he transferred to his sword, and struck hard.</p>
            <p>Wèi WúXiàn didn’t dare to block the attack. He thrust Suíbiàn into the riverbed, and, with his martial art skills and the support of his sword, he shielded the baby, leaned his body backwards, and avoided the blow.</p>
            <p>Looking like a madman, Fāng MèngChén laughed hideously, and said, “Wèi WúXiàn, are you not always going on the rampage? Why do you keep on dodging my attacks, instead of being violent?”</p>
            <p>As they carried on fighting, on the other side of the barrier of fierce corpses and water ghouls, the sound of the waves were getting louder; the intense waves kept on crashing against the barrier, and shaking the ground beneath them.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, as the time passed by, the red light on the barrier was getting dimmed, as the energy of the talismans progressively weakened.</p>
            <p>Anxious, Wèi WúXiàn said, “Wait for a moment that I fix the barrier.”</p>
            <p>Fāng MèngChén sneered, “There is no use trying to buy time, since today you won’t escape death. So, if the barrier is about to collapse, then let it collapse.”</p>
            <p>Greatly upset, Wèi WúXiàn thundered, “There are common people living downstream!”</p>
            <p>Fāng MèngChén shouted back, “It’s none of my concern!”</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>As a matter of fact, Fāng MèngChén’s spiritual power was not great, nor was his swordsmanship, however, his moves were quick.</p>
        <p>He knew that Wèi WúXiàn was running out of spiritual power, and noted that Wèi WúXiàn was not in a hurry to put an end to this fight, he only spent as less as possible his physical strength.</p>
        <p>Fāng MèngChén also observed that Wèi WúXiàn was doing his best to protect the baby, so, he began to direct his attacks towards Wèi WúXiàn’s chest, aiming at the little baby.</p>
        <p>Sadly, Wèi WúXiàn began to feel dizzy again, and, moreover, it was getting harder for him to handle his sword. Also, the more he used his spiritual power the more the agonising pain in his abdomen increased.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, he could not get close to and attack Fāng MèngChén, because he feared that he would put the little baby in danger of being harmed by Fāng MèngChén.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn knew that he could not hold on forever, so, he decided to take a risk. He moved one step backwards and his foot sank into the mud of the riverbed, and, deceitfully, revealing a flaw.</p>
        <p>As Fāng MèngChén charged once more, Wèi WúXiàn shielded the baby with the energy of his sword.</p>
        <p>However, Fāng MèngChén really took the bait, and, instead of aiming at Wèi WúXiàn’s chest as he formerly intended to do so, he directed his attack towards Wèi WúXiàn’s sunk foot and stabbed his shin.</p>
        <p>This new pain in his leg helped Wèi WúXiàn to clear his head of the dizziness that he was experiencing, and, without losing any moment, Wèi WúXiàn cut off Fāng MèngChén’s arm which was brought within his reach, using his spiritual power that he transferred into Suíbiàn.</p>
        <p>A stream of blood rushed in the air, and, in severe pain, Fāng MèngChén passed out instantly.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then said, “The trick to cutting off arms, I must confess that I learned it from Lán Zhàn.”</p>
        <p>Then, there was a little sound, like the noise of an extinguished fire, coming from Suíbiàn; it had exhausted all its energy.</p>
        <p>The next instance, Wèi WúXiàn sensed the cracks in his golden core widened, then, once more, his head began to spin, and, once again, he fell on his butt on the riverbed.</p>
        <p>At the moment he ended up sitting on the mud, the signal-transfer talisman that he had placed on his chest lit up. The ice-blue light of the talisman began to throb like a heartbeat.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn succeeds!” exclaimed Wèi WúXiàn, overjoyed.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the sound of the raging waves became more louder, the red light of the talismans went off, and the barrier weakened; it would not resist the pressure much longer.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the fierce corpses and water ghouls at the most top of the barrier began to fall off, resulting in a small stream of water pouring over.</p>
        <p>The stream progressively expanded as corpses and ghouls continued to fall off the barrier, and soon the small stream changed into a waterfall.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn was no longer able to stand up as his strength failed him.</p>
        <p>Enduring the pain in his abdomen, he quickly untied the blanket, stuck the signal-transfer talisman on the baby girl, fastened the blanket around Suíbiàn, then he sent Suíbiàn to stick on the trunk of a big tree near the riverbank.</p>
        <p>The small amount of spiritual power that Wèi WúXiàn had transferred into Suíbiàn was enough to cause more pain in his golden core vessel. He could even sense that his golden core was on the verge of shattering.</p>
        <p>Soon after Suíbiàn flew away with the baby, the barrier collapsed completely, and water rushed like a tsunami, the violent waves carried Wèi WúXiàn and Fāng MèngChén on their chaotic course downstream.</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, I won’t die.” swore Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>In this turmoil of the river, Wèi WúXiàn managed to use his last bit of spiritual power to protect the vital parts of his body, namely, the head, the neck, the chest and the abdomen, then, he lost his consciousness, engulfed into the darkness.</p>
        <p>The excessive use of his spiritual power had put a lot of strain on his newly formed and still fragile golden core. Like a crystal ball, it eventually broke into small pieces, which scattered and vanished within the golden core vessel.</p>
        <br />
        <p>--- --- ---</p>
        <br />
        <p>“My Lord, although Wèi WúXiàn is infamous, in fact, it is him who forms the bond between GūsūLán and LánlíngJīn sects, as well as the bond between GūsūLán and YúnmèngJiāng sects.</p>
        <p>“GūsūLán has no longer the desire to dwell on the past events related to Wèi WúXiàn. Jīn Líng, the young leader of LánlíngJīn, holds no longer any grudge against Wèi WúXiàn. Even Leader Jiāng, the uncle of the young leader, has changed his attitude towards Wèi WúXiàn; this is due to the attachment between the young leader and Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“In the past, Zéwú-Jūn, the leader of GūsūLán, Jīn GuāngYáo, the former leader of LánlíngJīn, and Chìfēng-zūn, my Lord’s big brother and our former leader, were sworn brothers. Back then, the three of them had formed a strong alliance.</p>
        <p>“Even after our former leader had passed away, Zéwú-Jūn and Jīn GuāngYáo were still treating QīnghéNiè sect very kindly, and giving us their support every time it was needed.</p>
        <p>“At the present time, however, QīnghéNiè has no bond with any other sects, at all.”</p>
        <p>Holding a fan in his hand, Niè HuáiSāng was slowly fanning himself, while quietly listening to his underling.</p>
        <p>The morning sun had not risen yet, and the night sky was not bright, putting a shadow on Niè HuáiSāng’s face, hence making it hard for the underling to see his lord’s expression.</p>
        <p>Two days ago, the news of Wèi WúXiàn, who went missing, came as a great shock among sects.</p>
        <p>Persistently, Lán WàngJī had since played his guqin, invoking and asking spirits the whereabouts of Wèi WúXiàn, until the strings of WàngJī broke off, cutting his fingers in the process. And the guqin was smeared with blood as a result of heavy bleeding.</p>
        <p>In the end, Lán WàngJī had located Wèi WúXiàn’s presence in the vicinity of Baihe, the suburb of Ankang City.</p>
        <p>So, cultivators from the four sects, who had come to assist in flash floods, took turn in searching and throwing nets in the river, day and night.</p>
        <p>Strangely enough, it was QīnghéNiè sect which found Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Unconscious, Wèi WúXiàn was lying on the riverbank of a tributary of the Ankang River.</p>
        <p>The underling resumed, “If Wèi WúXiàn happens to disappear without a trace, HánGuāng-Jūn will be deeply devastated.</p>
        <p>“Zéwú-Jūn has been living in seclusion for many years, so, right now, GūsūLán only relies on HánGuāng-Jūn. However, if HánGuāng-Jūn is lost without Wèi WúXiàn,  GūsūLán will be in an enfeebled state.</p>
        <p>“At the same time, with Wèi WúXiàn being no longer in this world, the connections GūsūLán has with LánlíngJīn and YúnmèngJiāng will be severed.”</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng remained silent, standing close to Wèi WúXiàn, who was still lying on the riverbank, looking ghastly with dark circles under his closed eyes, his lips had turned blue, and, moreover, he was soaking wet.</p>
        <p>Several years had passed since his return from death by the means of being invoked; the summoner offered his body in exchange of having his longing revenge to be done.</p>
        <p>Progressively, the appearance of Mò XuánYǔ, the summoner, had faded away, replaced by Wèi WúXiàn’s own face.</p>
        <p>Back when they were teenagers, and attending the school at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù*, Wèi WúXiàn once said, “The spiritual power is the energy, and the resentment** is also the energy. </p>
        <small>*Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù is the name the residence of the GūsūLán sect.</small>
        <br />
        <small>**Wèi WúXiàn refers to the resentment of a dead who died/got killed in cruelly way.</small>
        <p>“The spiritual power is stored in the golden core vessel, and can be used to split mountains, or be used in various ways for a good cause. So, why the resentment, also being the energy, is forbidden to be used in doing the same things as the spiritual power?”</p>
        <p>The argument that Wèi WúXiàn had put forward shocked everyone present in the classroom, and made Lán Lǎo, the teacher, extremely furious.</p>
        <p>Later on, after school, he said, “I don’t plan on leaving the path to a bright future, and walk on the wrong side of the road. It’s much easier to follow the path that someone else had taken.</p>
        <p>“So, don’t worry about what I have said earlier. I was just answering the questions that Lán Lǎo was asking me.”</p>
        <p>However, few years later, what he had said that it would not happen did happen; Wèi WúXiàn really walked on the wrong side of the road, found himself isolated and doomed.</p>
        <p>Back in that day, when he had been informed that the teacher punished him in copying the GūsūLán rules, Wèi WúXiàn exclaimed, “I’m not a member of the GūsūLán sect, or planning on becoming one. Why do I have to copy their rules. I won’t do it!”</p>
        <p>However, after his return, he had join the GūsūLán sect, and, with Lán WàngJī, they became a couple who lived in perfect harmony. And, furthermore, he seemed not to mind copying the GūsūLán rules.</p>
        <p>Inside the Guānyīn temple, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Leader Niè, do you know what was inside of this now-empty coffin?”</p>
        <p>“Indeed, time has passed and things have changed. At that time, he called me ‘Leader Niè’ instead of ‘HuáiSāng-xiōng’*.” said Niè HuáiSāng inwardly.</p>
        <small>*xiōng means literally brother. The suffix is informal and more friendly. So, Niè HuáiSāng complains that Wèi WúXiàn addresses him in formal way.</small>
        <p>Should they save Wèi WúXiàn, or should they not? The underling appeared to be nervous. It was impossible for him to guess what their leader was thinking, because whether he was happy or angry, Niè HuáiSāng would not let it show.</p>
        <p>After a while, Niè HuáiSāng said, “Give me the fireworks.”</p>
        <p>Concealing his disappointment, the underling respectfully handed four fireworks to their leader. The three of the fireworks belonged to GūsūLán, LánlíngJīn and YúnmèngJiāng sects, while the fourth was their own firework.</p>
        <p>For a while, Niè HuáiSāng fiddled with the fireworks that the underling began to think that their leader had changed his mind.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, Niè HuáiSāng pulled on the four strings of the four fireworks at the same time, and, the very next instance, the four emblems that represented the four sects were flickering in the night sky.</p>
        <p>Letting off the four fireworks was the agreed signal to let other sects know that Wèi WúXiàn was found, as well as giving the exact location he was found.</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng looked up into the sky, and, while gazing at the gorgeous fireworks, he nonchalantly said, “Spread the words of the Wěishàn villagers: ‘Yílíng Lǎozǔ forced us to leave our village, then flooded our homes, and destroyed the graveyard of our ancestors.</p>
        <p>‘He also caused a hundred of us to be separated from our families. The elderly and children were in tears.</p>
        <p>‘HánGuāng-Jūn is bewitched by Yílíng Lǎozǔ, indulging himself in crime, taking advantage of the high status of his sect to bully us. He arrogantly promised to compensate us for all our losses.</p>
        <p>‘And, finally, Yílíng Lǎozǔ experimented a new devilish technique at the remnant of the Ankang embankment that went wrong, and he ended up being washed away by the flood.’ ”</p>
        <p>By the time Niè HuáiSāng finished making up the story, the underling’s whole face lit up with excitement, “My Lord’s words are very thoughtful.”</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng rectified, “It’s not me who said these words. It’s what all the villagers from Wěishàn Village said. ”</p>
        <p>All the rest of underlings understood the cunning plan of their mission.</p>
        <p>Inwardly, Niè HuáiSāng said, “My dear Wèi-xiōng, I don’t have any intention of harming you. It’s just that the power between sects needs to be balanced.</p>
        <p>“However, you are so talented, by yourself you held a turbulent river back for quite a while; it is inconceivable.</p>
        <p>“GūsūLán should not carry on being complacent because they have you, who, alone, can withstand legions of troops.”</p>
        <p>All of a sudden, an ice-blue light flashed close by.</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng asked, “What was that?”</p>
        <p>The underling replied, “My Lord, it was the light produced by a teleportation.”</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng sighed, then said to himself, “HánGuāng-Jūn blew up an extremely stout dam by himself, then, for two days, he hasn’t rested but kept on playing his guqin in order to find Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>“Despite all this, he still has enough spiritual power to use a teleportation! It’s so lovely to see how deep his love goes.”</p>
        <p>A smiling expression appeared on Niè HuáiSāng’s face. He took off his outer robe, and used it to cover Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>Indeed, it was Lán WàngJī who arrived via a teleportation. His hands were shaking, his eyes were red, and his face was deadly pale. In fact, it was his whole appearance that was extremely dreadful.</p>
        <p>Niè HuáiSāng gently said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, don’t worry. Wèi-xiōng is still alive.”</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>In a gentle and sympathetic manner, Lán SīZhuī said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, you haven’t eaten anything for quite a while. Why don’t you go to the kitchen, so that the cook could serve you something to eat. Jīn Líng and I will stay here to watch over Wèi qiánbèi.”</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “I don’t need anything.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng and Lán SīZhuī exchanged a glance, and the latter shook his head in despair.</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng hesitantly said, “HánGuāng-Jūn, you... you only slept for three hours. Why don’t you rest a little bit more. SīZhuī and I will be waiting outside along with JǐngYí.”</p>
        <p>Noticing that the bed was wide enough, Jīn Líng wanted to add “You could sleep with Wèi WúXiàn”, but, on second thoughts, he bit his tongue.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī simply replied, “I’m fine. Don’t worry. Xiōng-zhǎng* has transferred in me some of his spiritual power.”</p>
        <small>*Lán WàngJī refers to his elder brother, Lán XīChén, also known as Zéwú-Jūn.</small>
        <p>Soon after Jīn Líng and Lán SīZhuī left the room, Lán WàngJī stood up from his chair, and went to sit on the bed. He held Wèi WúXiàn’s hand, closed his eyes and began to meditate.</p>
        <p>Was he tired? Yes, indeed, he was extremely tired. However, he didn’t want to fall asleep and miss the moment Wèi WúXiàn would wake up.</p>
        <p>Somehow, it seemed to Lán WàngJī that he constantly looked for Wèi WúXiàn. During the Shooting Sun campaign, Wèi WúXiàn went missing for three months since no one knew that he was thrown into the pit of the mass burial. After the bloodbath of Nightless Sky City, for thirteen years, he had looked and waited for Wèi WúXiàn to return.</p>
        <p>When Wèi WúXiàn came back, Lán WàngJī swore to protect him. However, despite his protection, Wèi WúXiàn was stabbed by Jīn Líng, and went into a coma for four days.</p>
        <p>Luckily, this time, it only took two days to find Wèi WúXiàn.</p>
        <p>And, two days had passed since Lán WàngJī took the unconscious Wèi WúXiàn back to Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.</p>
        <p>“Wèi Yīng, after the examination, the doctor didn’t find any internal injury, saying that you had protected your vital organs. In other words, there is nothing serious about your health condition.</p>
        <p>“So, please wake up soon. I miss you.” said Lán WàngJī.</p>
        <p>Outside, Jīn Líng, Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí were sitting on the porch of Jingshi*, and facing the front garden of the house, in which there were various types of plants.</p>
        <small>*Jingshi is the name of the dwelling of Lán WàngJī and Wèi WúXiàn.</small>
        <p>It seemed that Wèi WúXiàn had taken a liking to planting many different kinds of vegetation; he would, for instance, on one day dig a small pool for lotus plants, and on another day he would make a small squared field to grow watermelons, and so on.</p>
        <p>Moreover, here and there, there were different varieties of flowering plants, which offered a beautiful spring view.</p>
        <p>The front garden of Jingshi did no longer look like the previous plain garden.</p>
        <p>However, this splendid view was not enough to soothe Jīn Líng from being restless, plucking the flower stem of an orchid, he began to fidget with it, while Lán JǐngYí glared angrily at him for plucking the orchid, when, suddenly, they heard Lán WàngJī said, “Wèi Yīng, you’re awake.”</p>
        <p>The three of them rushed to get into the room, Lán JǐngYí tripped over the threshold and fell on the floor, Jīn Líng jumped over him and dashed towards the bed.</p>
        <p>Although his eyes were wide open, Wèi WúXiàn’s vision was blurred. Covering his forehead with one hand, and, with an alarming voice, he cried, “A child! There is a child!”</p>
        <p>Then, he raised his head, and, finally, he began to see clearly. He said, “It’s you, Lán Zhàn? Lán Zhàn, save the child, save the little baby.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī held his hand and said, “The baby is safe and sound. I found her by tracking your signal-transfer talisman. Right now, she is at the convent, and the nuns are taking care of her.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Oh, really?”</p>
        <p>Feeling a sudden sharp pain in his head as he tried to recall what happened, Wèi WúXiàn pressed his fingers on his temples, he had a vague recollection of the baby, however, he could not remember exactly who that baby was.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí had also reached the sickbed, Lán JǐngYí said, “Wèi qiánbèi, you scared us to death.”</p>
        <p>In a reproachful tone, Jīn Líng said, “Why are you always acting so recklessly? Are you still a kid or what?”</p>
        <p>Perplexed, Wèi WúXiàn looked at the three young boys, and noted that one was wearing a golden gown with a beautifully embroidered white peony on the chest, while the other two were wearing GūsūLán’s uniforms; a white gown with broad sleeves, an ornamental pendant dangling from the waist-belt, and a forehead ribbon with the curl cloud motifs.</p>
        <p>The three of them were looking at him with concern.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Who are you?”,  casting a quick look across the room, he added,  “And, where am I?” </p>
        <p>With a great astonishment, they all stared at Wèi WúXiàn in disbelief.</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng asked, “You don’t recognise me?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn looked carefully at the handsome young boy with a red dot on the forehead, and noticed that he bore a faint resemblance to Jiāng Chéng.</p>
        <p>He replied, “Sorry, I have a poor memory. I don’t recall seeing you before.”</p>
        <p>Not losing a moment, Lán JǐngYí asked, “Wèi qiánbèi, what about me? Don’t you remember me?”</p>
        <p>In a dispirited tone, Lán SīZhuī said, “Wèi qiánbèi, it’s me, SīZhuī.”</p>
        <p>With great attention, Wèi WúXiàn looked in turn at the two elegant boys of the young generation of the GūsūLán clan, then he shook his head in negation.</p>
        <p>Irritated, Jīn Líng thundered, “Wèi WúXiàn, if you are joking again, I’ll---”, he suddenly realised that Lán WàngJī was in the room, and quickly shut his mouth in panic.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn followed Jīn Líng’s gaze, as the latter cast a quick look at Lán WàngJī, who, in this room, was the only person Wèi WúXiàn knew.</p>
        <p>Then, all of a sudden, he asked, “Lán Zhàn, why are you looking so pale?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī, to whom the loss of Wèi WúXiàn’s memories came as a great blow, slowly began to loose his fist that he had clenched in shock. “At least, he still remember me.”, he said inwardly.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī gently said, “Wèi Yīng, this room’s name is Jingshi, it’s one of the dwellings of the GūsūLán residence. Right now, you are at Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù.”</p>
        <p>After a short pause, Lán WàngJī asked, “Wèi Yīng, what do you remember?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then tried hard to recall what he recently did or planned to do. There were buzzing noises inside his head, then, with a confusing mind, he suddenly cried, “Jīn Líng! I’m going to see Jīn Líng! The baby! I have to save the baby!”</p>
        <p>Then, he grabbed Lán WàngJīi’s sleeve, and asked, “Why do I remember that there is a baby who needs help? Is it Jīn Líng? Quick, take me to Jīnlíntái*!”</p>
        <small>*Jīnlíntái is the residence of the LánlíngJīn sect.</small>
        <p>Lán WàngJī held Wèi WúXiàn’s both hands, then said, “Wèi Yīng, calm down. It’s not Jīn Líng. It’s a baby girl whom you have already saved.”</p>
        <p>He resumed after a short pause, “Wèi Yīng, you had been washed away by the flood, then you went into a coma for four days. As a result, you have developed amnesia.”</p>
        <p>Pausing again to let Wèi WúXiàn understand the situation, Lán WàngJī once more reassured him, “Don’t worried for the baby girl. She is now at the GūsūLán’s convent.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn murmured to himself, “It’s not Jīn Líng.”</p>
        <p>Then, he looked up at Lán WàngJī, and said, “So, the one I rescued is not Jīn Líng but a baby girl.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī said, “Yes, that’s right.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn then asked, “Is the baby safe now?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “She is safe and sound. Later on, I’ll send someone to bring the baby here so you can see her for yourself.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn asked, “And, what about Jīn Líng?”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī cast a look at Jīn Líng, then replied, “Jīn Líng is also safe and sound.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī’s voice was deep and pleasing to the ear, it had a relaxing effect on Wèi WúXiàn’s anxious mind.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn finally calmed himself down, and appeared to be relieved. He said inwardly, “Since Lán Zhàn said that Jīn Líng is fine, then it must be true.” The noises inside his head began gradually to vanish.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī asked, “Wèi Yīng, what are your most recent memories? For example, what did happen yesterday or today? Or, what did you plan on doing tomorrow?”</p>
        <p>Carefully, Wèi WúXiàn tried to recollect his memories, then said, “The full month banquet! Tomorrow, I’m going to attend Jīn Líng’s one-month-old banquet.”</p>
        <p>Somehow, Wèi WúXiàn could not explain why it didn’t feel strange the fact that Lán WàngJī, who was sitting beside him, still holding his both hands.</p>
        <p>With his head tilted to one side, Wèi WúXiàn asked, “Lán Zhàn, are you coming as well?”</p>
        <p>Then, all of a sudden, he became very agitated again, he cried, “The silver orb! Where is the silver orb? You said that I was washed away by the flood, then, the sliver orb that I had on my sleeve is lost!”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng who, until now, was sulking could no longer hold his tongue, he asked, “What kind of silver orb?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn looked at Jīn Líng and sensed some sort of familiarity with him, he said, “I think there is no harm in telling you. It is the full month gift that I carved for Jīn Líng. It has a powerful charm to ward off evil spirits.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng became overwhelmed with emotion, which brought tears in his eyes. He took off his ring and handed it over to Wèi WúXiàn, while asking, “Is this ring has the same kind of the charm you just mentioned?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn took the ring and slightly stroked the golden stars engraved on it, then said, “Indeed, it has a similar charm, which is slightly better than the one I made.”</p>
        <p>“Oh!” he added, “Besides warding off evil spirits, the ring has other spells added into it.” </p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn carried on examining the ring, then said, “The person who made this charm is a genius, who is fairly better than me.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng took a deep breath, exchanged a glance with Lán SīZhuī and Lán JǐngYí, then, looking straight at Wèi WúXiàn, he calmly said, “I am Jīn Líng.”</p>
        <p>As Wèi WúXiàn got puzzled by what he just heard, Lán WàngJī briefly explained him the situation.</p>
        <p>“So, what you mean is...” Wèi WúXiàn remarked while eating the bowl of congee that Lán WàngJī served him, “... as I woke up from the coma, I have lost twenty years of memories.”</p>
        <p>“Lán Zhàn, is it true?” he asked after a short pause.</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī replied, “Yes, it’s true.”</p>
        <p>After finishing the bowl of congee, Wèi WúXiàn felt that his mind was completely cleared up, he said, “This is really interesting.”</p>
        <p>With a smile on his face, Wèi WúXiàn looked at Jīn Líng, then he said, “In other words, I didn’t see Jīn Líng when he was a baby, however, right now, I have in front of me the grown-up Jīn Líng.”</p>
        <p>Unsure, Jīn Líng asked, “Do you really accept as true that I am Jīn Líng?”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn replied, “Of course, I do. Why shouldn’t I accept it when HánGuāng-Jūn already said that it’s true?”</p>
        <p>“Hmm! The congee was really delicious.” Wèi WúXiàn remarked, “Lán Zhàn, GūsūLán has improved the taste of its cooking.”</p>
        <p>Lán WàngJī served him another bowl of congee.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn carried on, “Jīn Líng, to tell the truth, you look a little bit like your father, and a little bit like Jiāng Chéng. You even carry Suìhuá*. ”</p>
        <small>*Suìhuá is the sword of Jīn Líng’s father.</small>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn began to toss the ring up into the air, while saying, “Besides a genius like myself, I wonder who else is capable of making such a powerful charm.”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng was speechless, for an instance, he felt that Wèi WúXiàn didn’t lose his memories.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn gave back the ring to Jīn Líng, and asked, “What is the name of your ring?”</p>
        <p>“Golden Lightning.” replied Jīn Líng.</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “This name is really dull. Can’t you come up with another better name?”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng replied, “For example, The Supreme Mythical Peerless Precious Ring.”</p>
        <p>Wèi WúXiàn said, “Yes, why not?”</p>
        <p>Jīn Líng rolled his eyes in disbelief.</p>
